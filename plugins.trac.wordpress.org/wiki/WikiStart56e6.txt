= WordPress Plugin Repository = 

The idea behind this repository is to provide a rich environment for '''developers''' to create and share their work on WordPress-related plugin development. The [http://wordpress.org/ WordPress] plugins repository is a high-availability set of development tools -- a [wiki:TracWiki wiki], [wiki:VersionControl version control using Subversion], and [wiki:TracTickets bug tracker] -- that aims to nurture the active !WordPress development community. WP-Plugins.org is '''completely free''' to use.
