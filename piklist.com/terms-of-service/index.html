<p>Piklist is a property of Piklist LLC which provides website and software services to you subject to the following Terms of Service (“TOS”), which may be updated from time to time without notice. You can review the most current version of the TOS any time at: <a href="http://www.piklist.com/terms-of-service">http://www.piklist.com/terms-of-service</a>. In addition, when using any particular Piklist LLC-owned or -operated services, you and Piklist LLC shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be modified from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. Piklist LLC may also offer other services that are governed by different terms of service.</p>
<p><strong>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</strong></p>
<p>Piklist LLC provides users with access to a rich collection of resources, including various software tools, and personalized content through its network of properties which may be accessed through any medium or device now known or hereafter developed (the “Service”). You also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Piklist LLC to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from Piklist LLC, such as service announcements, administrative messages, and newsletter(s), and that these communications are considered part of your membership. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Piklist LLC properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided “AS-IS” and that Piklist LLC assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.</p>
<p><strong>3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>
<p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration form (the “Registration Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Piklist LLC has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Piklist LLC has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).</p>
<p><strong>4. PIKLIST LLC PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy. For more information, see our full privacy policy at http://www.piklist.com/privacy-policy. You understand that through your use of the Service you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Piklist LLC.</p>
<p><strong>5. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD, AND SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>You will create a password and account designation upon completing the Service’s registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Piklist LLC of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Piklist LLC cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 5.</p>
<p><strong>6. MEMBER CONDUCT</strong></p>
<p>You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted (“Content”), are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Piklist LLC, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service. Piklist LLC does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Piklist LLC be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.</p>
