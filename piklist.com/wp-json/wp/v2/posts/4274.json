It didn&#8217;t start out as the most powerful framework for WordPress.\u00a0What we originally planned was\u00a0an application-type plugin. \u00a0However,\u00a0we quickly realized\u00a0we were building a plugin that allowed you to build powerful applications.<\/p>\n<p>We took everything we knew about customizing WordPress and vowed to make it easier, and more powerful. Not an easy task.<\/p>\n<p>Using part files and comment blocks to configure parts of Piklist without writing PHP was one way we made WordPress easier. We had no idea if this was a good idea, or bad one, we just knew that we loved using it and hoped others would as well (and you definitely do!).<\/p>\n<p>The first feature we tackled was admin fields, the basic building blocks of the WordPress admin. \u00a0Then we started to include all aspects of WordPress; Widgets, Shortcodes, Admin Notices, Help Tabs, Pointers, Front End Forms, etc. \u00a0And also\u00a0included features to make WordPress even more powerful: WorkFlow Tabs, \u00a0Infinite Repeater Fields, Conditional Fields, Field Validation and more. \u00a0All the while making sure Piklist was easy to use.<\/p>\n<p>This is why we&#8217;ve kept Piklist in beta. \u00a0We wanted to make sure the processes\u00a0we were creating made sense as we added more features. Creating an enterprise level framework that&#8217;s also easy to use is a balancing act.<\/p>\n<p>We are now ready to bring Piklist out of beta!<\/p>\n<p>The first step is having you test version 0.9.9. We want to make sure your existing code and data work as expected. \u00a0There are two features we&#8217;ve updated in v0.9.9 that we believe needed to be changed before Piklist gets to v1.0.\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">Some of you may have to edit a little code but most should be fine.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>WorkFlow Tabs<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most powerful and popular features of Piklist are its Workflow tabs. However, this is one of those times we were\u00a0unhappy with the way you implement them. Unlike other parts of Piklist, you need to use a function, <strong>include_meta_boxes()<\/strong>, to include meta boxes into a flow. Not only is\u00a0this not the Piklist way, but it also limits the power of Workflow tabs.<\/p>\n<p>Starting in v0.9.9, the\u00a0<strong>include_meta_boxes()\u00a0<\/strong>has been replaced\u00a0with a more &#8220;Piklist-like&#8221; way of assigning sections to a WorkFlow. \u00a0You simply include the <strong>Flow<\/strong> and <strong>Tab<\/strong> parameters in the comment block of your section files (i.e. meta-boxes). Full documentation can be <a href=\"https:\/\/piklist.com\/user-guide\/docs\/building-workflows-piklist-v0-9-9\/\">found here &gt;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is one of those rare times when a Piklist\u00a0feature is not backwards compatible. Kevin and I debated long and hard about this, and ultimately decided this was the best way to go for both the project and you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> Existing Workflow tabs will not work until you make the change.<\/p>\n<h3>Add-More Field Data<\/h3>\n<p>Have you ever looked in your database and checked\u00a0at the data Piklist is saving for you? If not, we suggest you do. It&#8217;s beautiful. Seriously beautiful. We work had to make sure the data saved is simple to read and easy to use. \u00a0Feel free to compare it to other field frameworks. You will see a big difference.<\/p>\n<p>With almost every Piklist field you can use standard WordPress functions to retrieve your data. You already know how to use <strong>get_post_meta()<\/strong>, <strong>get_user_meta()<\/strong>, etc., so why should Piklist make you use custom functions instead? \u00a0The exception is the\u00a0Piklist Add-More repeater. \u00a0Since you can literally create infinite levels of add-mores, with totally different groups of fields, and re-sort them if you like&#8230; you can guess that the data saved is a serious array. In the past, this data needed to be passed through the <strong>piklist()<\/strong> function for you to retrieve and use it in your themes. \u00a0This is something that always bothered us. \u00a0We want your data to be beautiful, and with this field it wasn&#8217;t&#8230;until now.<\/p>\n<p>v0.9.9, Piklist will ask you to run a script to update your Piklist data. Once the update is complete, ALL Piklist data will be able to be pulled with standard WordPress functions. \u00a0Your existing Piklist code will be backwards compatible, however, any custom code you wrote targeting the old array structure will not work. \u00a0You will have to rewrite them. \u00a0<strong>IMPORTANT: Please back up your database before running the upgrade script and report any problems you see.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Post Relate Field<\/h3>\n<p>The post relate field is going away in Piklist v0.9.9&#8230; and will be replaced with an OBJECT Relate field. You will now be able to relate any object&#8230;to any object&#8230;to even another object. When you run the upgrade script your relate field data will be migrated to the new format, and the post_relationships table that Piklist created in the past will be removed. You should not have to do anything else.<\/p>\n<h3>Next Steps<\/h3>\n<p>Here is our plan to get Piklist to v1.0. We hope you can help.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Backup your websites database. We cannot stress this enough.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/piklist.zip\">Download v0.9.9 from WordPress.org trunk<\/a>, install, run the upgrade script and test, test, test. Test your code by editing a page that has Piklist fields on it, and then press save. \u00a0Do the fields look correct to you? Is the data displaying correctly on the front of your site?\u00a0Please let us know if you find any bugs by posting on our <a href=\"https:\/\/piklist.com\/support\/forum\/piklist\/\">support forum<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Test the built-in demos. Add some data&#8230;save&#8230;edit it&#8230;save&#8230;repeat.<\/li>\n<li>After we receive your feedback and make any necessary changes, we will mark\u00a0it as the active version on WordPress.org so everyone can easily upgrade with a push of a button.<\/li>\n<li>Once we are confident with the stability of v0.9.9, we will release v1.0.<\/li>\n<li>Other plugins like Toolbox and Fields and Forms will be released after Piklist is at v1.0. In hindsight, these plugins were announced prematurely. We realized that we need Piklist to be 100% stable before we can build plugins like these on top of it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Kevin and I both view version\u00a01.0 as just the beginning of Piklist. We have lots of ideas for features, plugins and add-ons once Piklist is at this point.<\/p>\n<p>As always, thank you for using Piklist and giving us your feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Please report all issues to the <a href=\"https:\/\/piklist.com\/support\/forums\/\">support forums<\/a>.
