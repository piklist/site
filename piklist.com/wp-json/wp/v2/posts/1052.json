And\u00a0why the sudden slow down with updates?<\/p>\n<p>Late last year we started getting more clients using Piklist and hiring us to build features. Some of these features were already on our roadmap, and some were totally off the map. \u00a0But they were all pretty awesome and would benefit the entire Piklist community, so we were excited to build them. As we started to enhance Piklist, we also realized some of the older code could be improved and we started to rewrite this as well. This included how Piklist stores field data, which is obviously a core feature. Before we knew it, we had a much better version of Piklist with tons of new functionality, but unfortunately, wasn&#8217;t 100% backwards compatible. To make matters worse, we never branched off our main Git repo, so we had no choice but to finish this version completely before releasing it. \u00a0During this process, clients started adding new features, and we got caught in a cycle&#8230; enhance Piklist&#8230; finish Piklist&#8230; enhance Piklist&#8230; finish Piklist&#8230; etc.<\/p>\n<p>We now believe this cycle is coming to an end and hope to have a new version of Piklist in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n<p>When it&#8217;s ready for testing, we&#8217;ll announce it here and let you now where you can download it.<\/p>\n<p>If you thought you could build amazing things now&#8230; just wait until you get your hands on the next version of Piklist!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Piklist community is really growing and we couldn&#8217;t be happier.
