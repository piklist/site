										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In October of 2015, we <a href="https://piklist.com/2015/10/06/piklist-v0-9-9-public-beta-and-next-steps/">released v0.9.9 of Piklist</a>. Your help in testing lead to seven(7) more releases, ending with v0.9.9.7 at the end of November. We were able to quickly fine-tune Piklist over those 60 days, while you reported issues.</p>
<p>In December, Kevin and I decided we needed to finish the unit tests if we wanted to get to v1.0. Together with the help of <a href="https://piklist.com/support/users/jasontheadams/">Jason Adams</a>, we finished all the unit tests we planned and fixed tons of little bugs.</p>
<p>Well, after two months and 350+ unit tests, v0.9.9.8 of Piklist is ready for download!</p>
<p><em>v0.9.9.8 is one small step for versions, and one giant step for code.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://piklist.com/trunk">You can download v0.9.9.8 from WordPress.org trunk.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We built Piklist from the ground up with security as our top priority. While we&#8217;ve taken every effort to consider security and privacy concerns while building this framework, we are aware that all software has bugs. Security in open source projects is a community effort, and we are now inviting the community to help.</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to announce the Piklist security bug bounty program on HackerOne. We are committed to working with the community to respond quickly to reported security issues and correct them. We will pay a reward for any legitimate security vulnerability reported responsibly through the program.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in getting paid to find security bugs, the <a href="https://hackerone.com/piklist/">Piklist HackerOne page</a> has the details on our program.</p>

<p>Managing your Post Types and Taxonomies just got easier. Way&#8230; easier. Piklist v0.8.0 sports a user interface for There are plenty of plugins available that allow you to manage custom Post Types and Taxonomies.  However, there are a few differences between them and the Piklist manager.</p>
<p>Piklist was built with the developer in mind, so managing your Content Types and Taxonomies can always be done at the file level. Other plugins let you do this with a user interface, which makes it a bit difficult to distribute your code. With Piklist you get the best of both worlds. Feel free to continue writing code, or if you like use the <em>optional</em> user interface to create and manage your Content Types and Taxonomies&#8230; or a combination of both.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, you also have access to all the extra Piklist parameters for <a href="http://piklist.com/user-guide/docs/custom-post-types/custom-post-type-parameters/">Content Types</a> and <a href="http://piklist.com/user-guide/docs/taxonomies/taxonomy-parameters/">Taxonomies </a>as well, so changing the &#8220;Enter Title&#8221; and removing meta boxes is a snap.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice as well that <strong><em>all</em> </strong>Content Types and Taxonomies are listed in the UI, not just the ones you created with Piklist. So you can easily edit the Content Types and Taxonomies in WordPress Core (i.e. Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags), or any created by other plugins.</p>
<p>To turn on the UI, head over to Piklist &gt; Settings and click on the Add-ons tab. Then choose which UI you want to use, and start configuring!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With WordPress 5.0 and Gutenberg scheduled for release tomorrow, we wanted to let you know the status of Piklist.</p>
<p>We have been working hard on not only making Piklist 100% Gutenberg compatible but doing it the Piklist way: Easy to use, beautiful, powerful and stable. Unfortunately, this version of Piklist will not be ready tomorrow. Though we are disappointed, we have decided not to rush to meet this deadline.</p>
<p>You can continue using Piklist on Custom Post Types (with the classic editor), Terms, Users, Settings, Widgets and Front End Forms. Piklist fields will not work on default POSTS and PAGES.</p>
<p>If you want to use Piklist on Posts or Pages, it is recommended that you install the &#8220;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/">Classic Editor</a>&#8221; plugin which ensures custom fields display as intended.</p>
<p>The next version of Piklist will not only be 100% Gutenberg compatible, but faster and even more powerful then before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we originally released Piklist in 2012, it has grown in functionality and complexity, and we&#8217;ve been trying desperately to explain all the amazing things Piklist can do for you. </p>
<p>Our first attempt at documentation was basic and the format couldn&#8217;t handle all of Piklist&#8217;s features.</p>
<p>Our second attempt was honestly a big mess. We tried to make our documentation visually appealing and cross-reference certain docs between different sections. The result was confusing&#8230; very confusing.</p>
<h3>We are proud to announce Piklist Documentation Version 3!</h3>
<p>Our new documentation site is clean and functional and does a much better job of organizing information.<br />
 Here is a list of some of the new features and benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Easy for you to contribute</strong><br />
Built on Github Pages and the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo framework</a>, the new Piklist documentation allows YOU to easily contribute and make changes, by creating a pull request. At the bottom of each page is an &#8220;Improve this page&#8221; button, that takes you to github and allows you to make changes.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing Search</strong><br />
The search bar is absolutely amazing. Try it, we guarantee you&#8217;ll like it.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong><br />
We&#8217;ve added more information about Piklist and how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>More Tutorials</strong><br />
Tutorials are the best way to learn about the astounding things you can do with Piklist, and our new docs have an expanded library of tutorials.</p>
<p><strong>Check out the new Piklist Documentation and let us know what you think: <a href="https://docs.piklist.com/">https://docs.piklist.com/ </a></strong></p>
<p>And while you&#8217;re at it, please download and test the <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist">latest Piklist beta on Github ></a></p>

IMPORTANT: Please make sure you read <a href="https://piklist.com/2016/06/09/piklist-v0-9-9-8-coming-need-know/">this post</a> before upgrading.</strong></p>
<p>Piklist v0.9.9.8 is now available for download. This version of Piklist is light years ahead of our last public version in terms of stability and security.  This version of Piklist also puts us much closer to releasing v1.0.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have restructured and updated our User Guide. As Piklist grew so did our documentation and the way we structured it. </p>
<p>Our new docs can be found at: <a href="http://piklist.com/learn">http://piklist.com/learn</a>.</p>
<p>They are still a work in progress, but you should find they have way more information then the old user guide.</p>
<p><a href="https://piklist.com/support/">As always, please let us know if you have any questions.</a></p>
