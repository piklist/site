						<p>First, I&#8217;d like to say this is an awesome project concept and I&#8217;m excited to see where it goes. </p>
<p>I just installed the initial release 0.5.0 and was able to add a Piklist Demo after activating it, but when I view the demo, I get a 404. Am I missing something here? </p>
<p>Also, your home page top nav does not have the documentation or tutorial links on it. It would be really helpful if it did, as I am sure we&#8217;ll be using them a lot as we work through learning more about what the plugin does. </p>
<p>Thanks again. Great idea.</p>

						<p><a href="https://piklist.com/support/users/lkincr/" class="bbp-user-mention bbp-user-id-6"> @lkincr</a>&#8211; thank you for the kind words. We have a lot more in store for you.<br />
1) visit your a permalinks settings page. That should remove the 404. Keep in mind the demo CPT is really for Backend admin. You would want to add the meta fields into your theme manually.<br />
2) links to Tutorials and Docs are updated!</p>
<p>Let us know if that works.</p>
