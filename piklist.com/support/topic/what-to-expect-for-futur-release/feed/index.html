						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First congratulation for Piklist, I feel it will be a very great tool for WordPress development.</p>
<p>I activate the plugin 0.6.1 with a 3.4.1 version of WP and this is my feedback:</p>
<p>&#8211; If the debug constant is set to true in the config.php file, there are lot of notices (undefined index, undefined constant, deprecated &#8220;get_theme_data&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8211; The features I expect for futur releases are :<br />
1- Possibility to reorder CPT by drag and drop<br />
2- Possibility to reorder Field group by drag and drop<br />
3- Possibility to have multiple Wysiwyg Editor on the same page, for instance one in each Field Group if you use add_more<br />
4- A WP media uploader field/bouton with thumb preview and a delete icon<br />
5- Add an update/save buton in each module to avoid scrolling on the top of the page</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a fan user of WPAlchemy from Dimas and Options Framework from Devin, but Piklist seems very promising, i could become a fan user of Picklist ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Thanks for your job</p>

						<p><a href="https://piklist.com/support/users/kattagami/" class="bbp-user-mention bbp-user-id-26"> @kattagami</a>&#8211; We&#8217;re so happy you like Piklist&#8230; and we aim to make you a super fan!</p>
<p>Notices: We are aware of the notices and will address them shortly. Currently, we&#8217;re working on stability and security.<br />
1) Not 100% clear on reordering CPT&#8217;s. Can you explain?<br />
2) Field groups for CPT&#8217;s are standard meta boxes and are drag-n-drop. For Settings, this is something we can look into.<br />
3) WYSIWYG editor in Add-More&#8217;s is on our roadmap. Definitely doable!<br />
4) Currently, working on first version of uploader. Hope to have it available next week.<br />
5) Piklist uses the standard WordPress API&#8217;s for Metaboxes and Settings (it just make them better).  Currently, this is not supported, but something we can consider for future releases.</p>
<p>Looking forward to making you a fan!</p>

						<p>Thank you Steve for your answer. </p>
<p>English is not my native language so I probably wasn&#8217;t be clear in my first expectation.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s very hepful to be able to re-order Custom Post Type in the backend.<br />
Plugins like &#8220;Simple page ordering&#8221; <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-page-ordering/" rel="nofollow">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-page-ordering/</a>  do that but the solution is not perfect yet. It could be nice to have the same thing in Picklist.</p>
<p>Point 2 you said: &#8220;Field groups for CPTâ€™s are standard meta boxes and are drag-n-drop.&#8221; In your dÃ©mo, when I use add_more button to duplicate a Field group, I can&#8217;t, for example, drag and drop the last field group to put it above the first one. Do I miss something ?<br />
Look at this picture to see what I mean, this picture speak better than my English ðŸ˜‰<br />

						<p><a href="https://piklist.com/support/users/kattagami/" class="bbp-user-mention bbp-user-id-26"> @kattagami</a>â€“ Your picture helps a lot.  </p>
<p>This is an interesting request. You want to be able to reorder add-more&#8217;s.  We will definitely put it on our feature request list.  I think it can be a very powerful tool.</p>

						<p>Yes i&#8217;m agree with @pdwouters, furthermore Github provides a RSS feed and it&#8217;s very handy to follow the commits so the diffrent new features.</p>

						<p>I agree with everyone as well, I contribute a lot to different projects, including pods, and you wouldn&#8217;t believe the amount of exposure, and contributions (bugs, features, etc) that GitHub could bring to this project.</p>
<p>Is there a specific reason you guys haven&#8217;t started using it yet?  I noticed that you guys have on the contributions page you plan to eventually move it over, any status on that?</p>
<p>In attempt to get more awareness of this project (I had no idea it existed 2 days ago, and still wouldn&#8217;t if I hadn&#8217;t randomly stumbled upon it looking for something else), I went ahead and imported all svn commits and setup a VPS to automagically sync svn to github with tags and commits:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tripflex/piklist" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/tripflex/piklist</a></p>
<p><a href="http://tripflex.github.io/piklist" rel="nofollow">http://tripflex.github.io/piklist</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start promoting this on other forums, irc, etc, as I know a ton of people would love this if they just knew it existed.</p>
