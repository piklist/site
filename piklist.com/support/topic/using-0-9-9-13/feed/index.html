						<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re currently using 0.9.9.13 I just want you to be aware that if you view the <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/releases" rel="nofollow">releases on Github</a> you&#8217;ll now see 0.10 Beta 1. This is the same exact release, we only changed the version.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because the difference between 0.9.9.12 and 0.10 is somewhat significant. There were considerable portions of code that were rewritten and optimized, fixing many of the bugs experienced. To better communicate this we bumped to 0.10. Also, since we haven&#8217;t released this on WordPress.org this is still considered a beta, which we greatly appreciate your testing, although we believe it&#8217;s even more solid than 0.9.9.12.</p>
<p>Please continue to test it out and make <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/issues" rel="nofollow">issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/pulls" rel="nofollow">pull requests</a> so we can make it&#8217;s final release as solid as possible.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping to make Piklist even better! It&#8217;s a community effort!</p>

						<p>Hi <a href="https://piklist.com/support/users/jason/" class="bbp-user-mention bbp-user-id-1363"> @Jason</a>, I recently started using Piklist.<br />
My first question, I posted on WordPress.org and piklist.com as was not sure which is the right one to get quicker turnaround.<br />
Installed 0.9.9.13 yesterday as I am unable to make advanced post relationship work and posted issue <a href="https://piklist.com/support/topic/related-posts-vs-postmeta/">here</a><br />
Now that code is hosted on Github, just wanted to confirm if </p>
<ol>
<li>Github will be the place to post future issues OR </li>
<li>Should we post only new version issues there OR</li>
<li>There will be an initial phase when issues need to be posted at both places i.e new ones on Github and continue with old ones here till everything is migrated to github</li>
</ol>
<p>As per the initiative to involve community, I assume #3 might be the case but just wanted to confirm so as to not duplicate the issue mentioned above on Github.</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

						<p>Hi <a href="https://piklist.com/support/users/bhushanjawle/" class="bbp-user-mention bbp-user-id-2143"> @bhushanjawle</a>!</p>
<p>Sorry you&#8217;re having issues with the relate functionality. You&#8217;re definitely doing something pretty advanced, which is awesome. I know it&#8217;s supported, there must be a bug we need to find (or there&#8217;s a syntax I&#8217;m not remembering).</p>
<p>Otherwise great question!</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have any present plans on removing the forums. Currently users can get support on the plugin page on WP.org, here, and now Github. I would say that, at least for now, I would recommend that our users that are developers start taking advantage of the issues on Github. The reason being that it&#8217;s better suited for exchanging code, referring to other issues/pull requests, and allowing us to organize issues with labels and milestones.</p>
<p>Let me know if this makes sense!</p>

						<p>Thank you <a href="https://piklist.com/support/users/jason/" class="bbp-user-mention bbp-user-id-1363"> @Jason</a>. Will create this as new issue on Github. What I am doing is this, trying to create a related custom post type from another (with add-more).<br />
There must be something I am missing with syntax. If you get a chance, please have a look <a href="https://piklist.com/support/topic/related-posts-vs-postmeta/">here</a> . I have posted code and screenshot.</p>

						<p>I&#8217;m having the hardest time with the Beta version. I&#8217;ve turned off everything plugins and themes so that I could turn off version 9.9.12. Installing the Beta version throws this error on the user Admin edit page. And I still just see the piklist demos tabs and not just the user admin area normally seen:</p>
<p><strong>Warning: end() expects parameter 1 to be array, null given in /Users/alicia/Sites/cazoozwinner.dev/wp-content/plugins/piklist-0.10-beta.2/parts/shared/admin-workflow.php on line 68</strong></p>
<p>On the demos:</p>
<p>Taxonomy Error:</p>
<p><strong>Warning: File does not exist: .php in /Users/alicia/Sites/cazoozwinner.dev/wp-content/plugins/piklist-0.10-beta.2/includes/class-piklist.php on line 530</strong></p>

<p>Not sure what I&#8217;m doing wrong&#8230;.</p>

						<p>You are absolutely right! I will make issues for these on Github to make sure they&#8217;re fixed in the next beta release.</p>
<p>In the future, for the beta, please report things on the Github repository to keep the beta issues in one place.</p>
<p>Thank you! ðŸ™‚</p>

						<p><a href="https://piklist.com/support/users/intrepidrealist/" class="bbp-user-mention bbp-user-id-1780"> @intrepidrealist</a> just to be clear, these are warnings and, while they shouldn&#8217;t exists, they don&#8217;t seem to negatively affect any of the functionality. That just means that you have WP_Debug turned on and have it set to display errors. Otherwise those would happen silently. Again, they will be fixed, I just don&#8217;t want you to think they&#8217;re major. ðŸ™‚</p>
