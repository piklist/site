						<p>I tried the checlist field with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;checkbox&#039;,
    &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;my_checkbox&#039;,
    &#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Checkbox&#039;,
    &#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;third&#039;, // set default value
    &#039;choices&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;first&#039; =&gt; &#039;First Choice&#039;,
      &#039;second&#039; =&gt; &#039;Second Choice&#039;,
      &#039;third&#039; =&gt; &#039;Third Choice&#039;
    )
  ));</code></pre>
<p>When I see the code from the browser, I found the following result:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;    
      &lt;label class=&quot;piklist-field-list-item&quot;&gt;  
        &lt;input 
          type=&quot;checkbox&quot;
          id=&quot;my_checkbox_0&quot; 
          name=&quot;my_checkbox[]&quot;
          value=&quot;first&quot;
                    class=&quot;my_checkbox piklist-field-type-checkbox piklist-field-element&quot;         /&gt;         
          &lt;input 
            type=&quot;hidden&quot;
            id=&quot;my_checkbox_0&quot; 
            name=&quot;my_checkbox[]&quot;
            value=&quot;&quot;
          /&gt;
      
                
        &lt;span class=&quot;piklist-list-item-label&quot;&gt;
          First Choice        &lt;/span&gt;
    
      &lt;/label&gt;
  
    &lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There is a hidden field come out from the code. What should I do to correct this?</p>

						<p>I have a front-end form that creates a post. The post is created just fine and I can see the input data in $_POST, but how do I access the ID of the newly-created post so I can do something with it? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m using 0.9.9.8. In 0.9.5v, the new ID showed up in a hidden ID field, but now that field is empty: </p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;hidden&#039;,
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;ID&#039;,
	&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;,
	&#039;required&#039; =&gt; false,
));
</code></pre>
<p>I tried the new-post-with-validation.php form in piklist-demos, but its $_POST results don&#8217;t include an ID field. </p>
<p>Thanks for any clues as I&#8217;ve been banging my head on this for an hour! </p>

						<p>I am running PIKLIST Version 1.0.11 on WordPress 5.5.7. WordPress notes that WordPress 5.8.2 is available for install. Should I do an install to 5.8.2?</p>
<p>I updated PHP from 7.3 to 8.1 and for right now on 5.5.7 I am getting these error in the Windows Logs:</p>
<blockquote><p>PHP Warning: include_once(D:\www\0\www_blog_ch\wordpress\blog\wp-content\plugins\piklist/includes/wp-login.php.2018-06-14_103024.bak): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory in D:\www\0\www_blog_ch\wordpress\blog\wp-content\plugins\piklist\includes\class-piklist.php on line 201</p></blockquote>
<p>How can I get these fixed?</p>

						<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Trevor Roberts, and I first came across Piklist a couple of years ago. I am self taught and have mostly built websites for myself. This month, I started using Piklist in earnest and I plan to use it on all websites I build in future.</p>
<p>I would also like to assist with some translation work, if possible. I have signed up for the beta program, but have not received any news about that yet.</p>
<p>Although I think my skills are somewhat limited, I plan to be an active member of the community and help in any way I can. </p>
<p>A big thanks to the developers for producing such an awesome Framework.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a wonderful weekend!</p>

						<p>Hello, I am a newbie theme developer. Recently I was learning piklist and implementing myself. I found that add_more is not working with gutenberg but when I activate classic editor it works fine. Is it any issue with my code or piklist dd_more (repeater) is not compatible with gutenberg?<br />
 Thanks</p>

						<p>Hey guys!;</p>
<p>I have a website that plays music by connecting with SoundCloud via Ajax to get a playable stream.</p>
<p>In this way users can complete a form created with Piklist to publish their music on our website.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m having a problem because the form created with Piklist says “Request failed: error” when a SoundCloud link is pasted into the field designated for that.</p>
<p>Everything was working perfectly until just a few weeks ago, I thought that it would be resolved with an update or that it was perhaps a conflict with some other plugin but I have uninstalled one by one and none of these changes.</p>
<p>Please help me, Thanks!</p>

						<p>Hi,<br />
Thanks for the plugin, we use it lots and it&#8217;s really useful!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve encountered a weird bug, where I create a custom post type using the filter <code>piklist_post_types</code>, permalinks of pages of that custom post type get overwritten every time you save the page. Using the exact same array and creating the post type using WordPress&#8217; own register_post_type method fixes the issue. It doesn&#8217;t block me, as I will use the native method, but I wanted to let you know anyway.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
