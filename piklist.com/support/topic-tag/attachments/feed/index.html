										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Is there anyway to to add attachments using piklist rather than adding them in the content area via the &#8220;insert Media&#8221; button in the wysiwyg? </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to use a custom field, I want to select them via a piklist field and then store them how wordpress stores them &#8211; as attachments.</p>
<p>I then want to use something like &#8220;get_attached_media( &#8216;image&#8217;, $post_id )&#8221; to get the attachments.</p>
<p>I did try to use the code from the demo: https://gist.github.com/beatelite/eecbbd5b301ac62583b9245af5547278</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s doing this weird thing where when I select three images and then publish, all three images become the first one selected. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MfNye3lvLrzwnu59TQ62d4AykZahzm2y</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a CPT (&#8220;product&#8221;) and I need two kinds of multiple images: composed product images and candid product-in-use images. I&#8217;ve read your post about &#8220;Multiple Featured Images&#8221; and see &#8220;field-featured-image.php&#8221; on GitHub so I assume I can use this approach for the composed product images.</p>
<p>But what about the candid product-in-use images? Was thinking they could simply be attachments. I could use the built-in attachment support, or get some additional control by using using the &#8220;Attachments&#8221; plugin. But is there something I can do with Piklist to make managing attachments easier? It would be awesome, for example, if I could SEE the attached images on the CPT screen. As you know, attaching images via editor is invisible.  And being able to delete an attached image on the CPT screen would be even awesome-r!</p>
<p>Thoughts &amp; advice most welcome!      </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys, tried searching for this issue both now and a while back but haven&#8217;t encountered anyone having posted about this problem.</p>
<p>Thing is, I have a meta box on a custom post type where the user can upload several attachments (see screenshot). But, when I try to remove either one of them (or both), they just re-appear once I press Update.</p>
<p>Did some debugging and the click on remove only removes the ui-sortable item, it doesn&#8217;t clear/remove the hidden input-field which piklist uses then saving and then are using as the base for building the ui-sortable list in the meta box.</p>
<p>Seems odd that someone else wouldn&#8217;t have encountered this before, which makes me questioning if I implemented it wrongly?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an extract from my metabox-code (disregard the validation-rule, doesn&#8217;t seem to work either):</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;
	,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;noas_product_attachments&#039;
	//,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;
	,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Attachment&#039;
	,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
		&#039;modal_title&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add&#039;,&#039;noas&#039;)
		,&#039;button&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add&#039;,&#039;noas&#039;)
	)
	,&#039;validate&#039; =&gt; array(
		array(
			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;limit&#039;
			,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
				&#039;min&#039; =&gt; 0
				,&#039;max&#039; =&gt; 2
			)
		)
	)
));</code></pre>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi PikList Team, I am wondering if it is possible to set the Mime-type for an attachment within the array for the &#8220;File&#8221; field type. Â Maybe something like this: piklist(&#8216;field&#8217;, array( &#8216;type&#8217; =&#62; &#8216;file&#8217; ,&#8217;post_mime_type&#8217; Â =&#62; &#8216;image&#8217; )); I would then like to loop through the attachments for a post and filter for certain mime-types. [&#8230;]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi PikList Team,</p>
<p>I am wondering if it is possible to set the Mime-type for an attachment within the array for the &#8220;File&#8221; field type. Â Maybe something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>piklist(&#8216;field&#8217;, array(<br />
&#8216;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;file&#8217;<br />
,&#8217;post_mime_type&#8217; Â =&gt; &#8216;image&#8217;<br />
));</p></blockquote>
<p>I would then like to loop through the attachments for a post and filter for certain mime-types. Â For example just display the images, or just the PDFs or whatever.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to do this?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
