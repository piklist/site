										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hullo there, I&#8217;m running Piklist 0.9.9.9. I had tabs working earlier in version 0.9.4.31 however now the are not. Well, I&#8217;ve tried re-doing the entire thing since I already had my settings files but still they don&#8217;t appear even though I follow the documentation step-by-step to make it happen. I&#8217;ve tried removing all tab related parameters from the comment block of all settings files and only left them on two as the documentation directs but still the tabs won&#8217;t appear. All that Piklist does is to show all my settings fields on the same long page instead of place each setting file under a defined tab. What do I do about this coz I&#8217;m I&#8217;ve failed to make it work even with the documentation. In addition to that, even the demo won&#8217;t disable. When I go the Piklist menu &gt; Addons and then click on the disable button and then click &#8216;<em>Save settings</em>&#8216;, nothing happens. The disable button does not change state to show activate and simply remains as it were with the demos still active and the notice that says <em>&#8220;Piklist Demos are activated.<br />
Demos should only be used as a resource, and turned off during normal website operation.&#8221; still shows. What do I do for these problems?</em></p>
