										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have done a fair bit of searching and I haven&#8217;t found any simple way with any existing technology to have a separate set of terms for each user ( ie where the user owned their own terms &#8230; so that they could return their own queries based on their own personal categorization of the blog&#8217;s content) &#8230; I do have an idea of how this could be done and I&#8217;m going to start that experiment soon but I thought first I&#8217;d ask to see if I&#8217;m missing something and maybe Piklist can do it, or help.</p>
<p><strong>Example of operation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are 3 posts in the blog and 2 users.</li>
<li>The first user tags Post 1 and 2 as &#8220;foo&#8221; and Post 3 as &#8220;bar&#8221;</li>
<li>The second user tags Post 2 and 3 as &#8220;baz&#8221; and post 1 as &#8220;qux&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p> &#8230; so that User 1&#8217;s tags are completely autonomous from User 2.</p>
<p><strong>Example of use</strong><br />
My email program (Thunderbird) lets me tag emails according to my own workflow. I&#8217;m not going to use this in a regular blog but I can imagine a scenario where a a large blog with data heavy content might let it&#8217;s users categorise it&#8217;s content based on their own prefs &#8230; a sort of bookmarking system.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts I&#8217;d be grateful to hear them.</p>
<p>NB I don&#8217;t think <strong>User Taxonomies</strong> would help as they seem to be just a way of categorising users, unless I&#8217;m missing something.</p>
