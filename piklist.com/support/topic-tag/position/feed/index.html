										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After installing Piklist (for use with WordPress Helpers), I now find that I cannot re-order any of the metaboxes on my edit screens.  That is, I can move them around, but their positions are no longer saved.  Deactivating Piklist solves this problem, but reactivating it causes the metaboxes to go back to the order they were in before I disabled Piklist. I&#8217;d like to continue using Piklist, but I can&#8217;t have Metaboxes like &#8220;WordPress SEO&#8221; and &#8220;Revisions&#8221; appearing at the top of my edit pages above everything else.  </p>
<p>I see no settings in Helpers, and the problem exists even when Helpers is disabled but Piklist is enabled. Is there a solution to this problem?  </p>
