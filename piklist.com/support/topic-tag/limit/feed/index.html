										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Steve</p>
<p>I updated a settings function to impose a limit of 1 file upload for the site logo as you can see in the attached.</p>
<p>However, on save, I keep getting the error &#8220;Add File must have exactly 1 items added.&#8221; even though I&#8217;ve only selected one image.</p>
<p>I checked the database and I don&#8217;t see any settings for this field so I can&#8217;t find any conflicts in the DB. </p>
<p>Prior to this, I ran into a problem when I replaced the image with another and the setting created an array on the backend. The image wasn&#8217;t displayed on the front-end given that it was referencing the first instance in the array if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the settings code:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;checkbox&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;gwfg_use_image_for_logo&#039;
    ,&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;&#039; //
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Use image for logo?&#039;
    ,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;If left unchecked, plain text will be used instead (generated from site name).&#039;
    ,&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;use-logo&#039; =&gt; &#039;Yes&#039;
    )
));

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;gwfg_site_logo&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Add File&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;
    ,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Upload your movie logo.&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    ,&#039;options&#039;          =&gt; array(
      &#039;modal_title&#039;   =&gt; __(&#039;Add File&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
      ,&#039;button&#039;       =&gt; __(&#039;Add&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
  )
  ,&#039;validate&#039;         =&gt; array(
    array(
      &#039;type&#039;          =&gt; &#039;limit&#039;
      ,&#039;options&#039;      =&gt; array(
        &#039;min&#039;         =&gt; 1
        ,&#039;max&#039;        =&gt; 1
      )
    )
  )
  ));
