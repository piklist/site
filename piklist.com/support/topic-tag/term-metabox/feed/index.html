										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! How do i connect multiple taxonomies in a post? Lets say i have a post called business and i have 3 taxonomies for the post type business which are countries, cities and states.</p>
<p>Inside my business post type i would like to only show cities if a country is selected and only show cities connected to the selected countries.</p>
<p>I know i could do this by using 1 taxonomy called location but if you are to put lots of countries cities and state it can be hard to manage. so instead i would like to separate them into 3 taxonomy.</p>
<p>I know piklist is very flexible that i can add a field inside a term like to select another taxonomy as its parent. But I have no idea of how to do this.</p>
<p>I would also like to show this taxonomies inside the business post type post but would like it to be like a step by step feature. like if in the country i select japan.</p>
<p>the city or state metabox will show up but only show terms that is associated with the japan country.</p>
<p>I hope someone can guide me on how to do this. Thanks!</p>
