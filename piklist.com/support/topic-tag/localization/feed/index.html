										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just found a really weird issue. I&#8217;m making a client for a Spanish speaking client, and I noticed that I could no longer publish custom post types: when I clicked &#8220;Publish&#8221;, it saved as draft, and the &#8220;Save&#8221; button was gone. I spent a few hours testing, and I realized that the issue appears when I switch the site to Argentinian Spanish (es_AR). I tested other languages (Catalan, Japanese and Mexican Spanish) and there is no problem with them, just with Argentinian Spanish.</p>
<p>Here is a screencap of how the edit screen looks: http://jmp.sh/NNSFfgY</p>
<p>I also tested with a custom post type that I coded the regular WordPress way. If Piklist is enabled, the issue is also present when trying to publish this post type, but as soon as I disable Piklist, everything is fine. So the problem seems to be Piklist + Argentianian Spanish.</p>
<p>I realize that this is a really strange issue, but I would really appreciate help debugging and figuring out what is wrong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to replace the default quotes in WordPress (&#8221; &#8220;) with their german equivalents („ “). Adding a filter to the_content and doing a str_replace works fine for normal post and page content but of course not for custom fields.</p>
<p>I found a solution using output buffering to do a string replace on everything before a page is sent to to browser. Again it works fine everywhere but my Piklist fields. </p>
<pre><code>ob_start();

add_action(&#039;shutdown&#039;, function() {
    
    $final = &#039;&#039;;

    $levels = ob_get_level();

    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $levels; $i++)
    {
        $final .= ob_get_clean();
    }

    // Apply any filters to the final output
    echo apply_filters(&#039;final_output&#039;, $final);

}, 0);

add_filter(&#039;final_output&#039;, function($text) {

  $text = str_replace( &#039;&#8220;&#039; , &#039;&#8222;&#039; , $text );
  $text = str_replace( &#039;&#8221;&#039; , &#039;&#8220;&#039; , $text );
  $text = str_replace( &#039;&#8216;&#039; , &#039;&#8218;&#039; , $text );
  $text = str_replace( &#039;&#8217;&#039; , &#039;&#8216;&#039; , $text );
  return $text;

});</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve already tried different hooks to no avail. Can you think of another simple solution that would work with Piklist&#8217;s custom field content without having to deal with it on a field by field basis?</p>
<p>Thank you<br />
Stefan</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In my arrays for example I am adding __(&#8221;) for localization to translate my plugin. Can tab names be localization-ready since they are named in the header comments? IE: &#60;?php /* Title: Countries Order: 20 Setting: cipb_settings Tab: Countries */</p>
