										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Before I jump deep into this I wanted to see if indeed the Piklist can do what I&#8217;m aiming for. I have limited coding experience and even less time to learn as I&#8217;m too busy running the business, sadly some of that time is wasted with current useless workflow which I&#8217;m hoping to negate, sadly no amount of searching has produced a plugin, paid or otherwise that can manage it.</p>
<p>Essentially I want I want a plugin that pretty much does this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqNdZ1AY04 (not a long video so hoping you&#8217;ll watch). Except where it gets to &#8216;send&#8217; quote instead of a rather naff email, the enquirer is sent a link to a lovely (unique) landing page, which contains their individual price list, from which they can choose and order/buy?  Said enquirer when converted to a &#8216;customer&#8217; can then return to their own private area on our site and view any document, messages, invoice, further quotes and so on. Additional areas for the venue, 3rd party staff, event calendar are all relevant. (the author of that plugin does not see these additional options being added.) </p>
<p>So my questions are &#8211; can piklist more or less recreate this but enhance it with the updates I mentioned ? </p>
<p>Am I as a basic wordpress user, dreaming that piklist is that simple within a few evenings work I can have it up and running?</p>
<p>So far all I have is one of the ugliest user list pages ever seen, which is the default WP screen smattered with references to piklist code &amp; no idea where to start.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
