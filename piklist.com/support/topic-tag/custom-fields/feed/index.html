										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>first: Piklist is a great tool!!</p>
<p>Actually i work on a client project with an custom Partner-Management. I tried out different plugins like Members, WP-Members and so on, but nothing was the right plugin for the project.</p>
<p>Piklist seems to be the right base for the whole project and for building all the future features we have planned&#8230;</p>
<p>Two questions at the start:<br />
1: is it possible with piklist to add custom fields to the user profile? Because in the docs there are just tutorials for custom post types.</p>
<p>2: All Partners, with the basic informations, will be registered by an admin. And we need unique Partner-Numbers within two groups: Partner and Customer. So the idea is, that a new partner gets a number like P123456 and a new customer a number like C123456. But we don&#8217;t want to give the numbers per hand. Is it possible to give this numbers automatic for new partners and new customers?<br />
All, partner and customer, are &#8220;Users&#8221; with different registration and different roles and capabilities&#8230; We need this to manage future features.</p>
<p>Many thnx for your support in advanced,<br />
Roland</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Piklist Community,</p>
<p>Thank you for this excellent framework.  Glad to be on the bleeding edge.</p>
<p>I must be doing something wrong in my plugin for &#8216;Real Estate Listings&#8217;.  I have carefully reviewed the demos and tutorials and have built a piklist plugin.  All of my meta-boxes are showing up, but the values I enter into them are not saving when I &#8216;publish&#8217; the custom post type &#8216;listings&#8217;.  The plugin can be <a href="http://www.crownisle.com/ci-dev/crownisle-re-listings.zip">downloaded here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the piklist checker seems to always think that I do not have piklist plugin installed.  Should I provide an absolute path to the class-piklist-checker.php file?</p>
