										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a select field &#8220;Turn X on/off&#8221; and a set of fields that either hide or show up depending on the value of select. Most of these fields are required.</p>
<p>The problem is that when I select option &#8220;off&#8221; in the first select and try to save, then I get notice that there are some required fields that I need to fill in and I can&#8217;t save. Is it a bug or is this feature not implemented yet?</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
<p>BTW. I haven&#8217;t praised you for quite some time now, so&#8230; Good job:) Piklist is fantastic even though it&#8217;s still not perfect.</p>
