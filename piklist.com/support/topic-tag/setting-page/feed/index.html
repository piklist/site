										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have admin setting page, which have different tabs. It worked well with old version but when i update to beta version 0.9.9.2, Tabs not working. </p>
<p>I tried with the documentation provided in other ticket for same but still not working. Let me know step by step procedure on how i can make it right. Below is a files and folder structure for same</p>
<p>My Plugin<br />
/inc<br />
  wp-hr-pages.php &#8211; it have code which adds custom setting page<br />
/parts<br />
  /settings<br />
     general-tab.php &#8211; tab fields for setting page<br />
     advance-tab.php &#8211; tab fields for setting page<br />
  /workflows<br />
     page-settings.php &#8211; main workflow header file<br />
     general-tab.php &#8211; tab declaration for workflow<br />
     advance-tab.php &#8211; tab declaration for workflow</p>
<p>Let me know if there is anything wrong in it. I think there is quite less documentation on how to build setting stuff.</p>
