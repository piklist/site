										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in desperate need of a solution for this. I have a multi-page front end form with many different required file uploads.</p>
<p>Piklist does a fine job of making sure you can&#8217;t move to the next page without submitting the required info. However, when you go back to that page after advancing in to process, you can see that the image is stored here&#8230;</p>
<p><img src='https://s30.postimg.org/jlka8g89t/Screen_Shot_2017_01_26_at_10_10_37_AM.png' border='0' alt="Screen Shot 2017-01-26 at 10.10.37 AM" /></p>
<p>But when you attempt to move on again, it acts as if it doesn&#8217;t know the file exists (despite the fact that you&#8217;re looking at a preview).</p>
<p><img src="https://s28.postimg.org/mqvabaa7x/Screen_Shot_2017_01_26_at_10_29_33_AM.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working at this for a while, looking for ways to even work around Piklist for this one input type, but I&#8217;m not having any luck getting it integrated back into the Piklist flow.</p>
<p>HELP!!</p>

<p>The problem is that when I select option &#8220;off&#8221; in the first select and try to save, then I get notice that there are some required fields that I need to fill in and I can&#8217;t save. Is it a bug or is this feature not implemented yet?</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
<p>BTW. I haven&#8217;t praised you for quite some time now, so&#8230; Good job:) Piklist is fantastic even though it&#8217;s still not perfect.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve got a conditional field which is working as expected. However, I&#8217;d like to make this field Required based on the same conditions that shows/hides the field. Currently, updating the post even when the field is still hidden triggers a Required error. Any way to work around this?</p>
