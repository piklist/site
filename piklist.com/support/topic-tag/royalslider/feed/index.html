										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to have the shortcode from RoyalSlider plugin appear in the Piklist shortcodes.</p>
<p>At first I just tried adding it via the &#8220;Allow Shortcode UI&#8221; in Piklist&#8217;s &#8220;Settings&#8221;. But it doesn&#8217;t work? It is not appearing in the shortcodes windows next to Piklist Form as expected. Is there something I am missing?</p>
<p>I then startet creating a Piklist shortcode manually that would just print out the RoyalSlider. It requires an &#8220;id&#8221; attribute, but I noticed that &#8220;id&#8221; is not accepted as field in my piklist shortcode (or it is ignored). But if i set it to &#8221; id&#8221; (with a space) it will appear in the shortcode (and even appears to work).</p>
<p>I have tested it with only Piklist adn RoyalSlider on a fresh WordPress installation on Linux server.</p>
