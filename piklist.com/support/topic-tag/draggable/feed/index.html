					<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve referenced the docs and it says to use &#8220;Lock: true&#8221; in the comment block attributes and &#8220;Locked: true&#8221; in the example code. https://piklist.com/user-guide/docs/file-structure/meta-boxes/ Neither seems to be working for me.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>I have two questions &#8211; Firstly, I have a group of fields that I have set as an add-more field. In this is a canvas with draggable images. The problem is, dragging causes piklist to try to reposition the group. Any way to disable this?</p>
<p>Secondly, an issue I am facing is that with the add-more group, id&#8217;s in the HTML do not change upon duplicating the form, resulting in conflicts between the different &#8216;instances&#8217;, so to speak. Is there any way that you can think of to easily detect that a new &#8216;instance&#8217; has been created?</p>
