										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to Lock the values of fields based on the capability of the person viewing them?</p>
<p>For instance one person creates, while a reviewer cannot edit but must still see the entry details.</p>
<p>The following tut only seems to deal with Post Status:<br />
https://piklist.com/user-guide/tutorials/creating-meta-boxes-fields/lock-field-values-based-on-post-status/</p>
<p>From user feedback it would be best if I used Capability, but I&#8217;m not able to find any information in the Docs as to where that is possible. </p>
<p>If not possible in a stable build, is it possible for me to add it in somehow?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />
Zane</p>
