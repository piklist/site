										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I recently use piklist for my big project, and this plugin is very good, but I have some issue when I create two plugin with piklist after that I create custom post type for those two separately  use filter `piklist_post_types for both plugin one of custom post type do not create it, only the first one I made successfully create the other one is not. I do not know what I made it wrong is it because those filter only can be use once even we create two different plugin. (Sorry for my english). I hope there is a solution for this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is there a way to connect 2 different post types?<br />
I have a post type &#8220;players&#8221; with a taxonomy &#8220;teams&#8221;. I store there information about football players (1 post = 1 player). And of course I store information about teams in taxonomy (1 term = 1 team). This structure helps me to connect players with their teams.<br />
But right now I need to create one more post type &#8211; &#8220;matches&#8221;, where I&#8217;ll store all information about matches and I want to store information about players also. Right now with Piklist I can create few meta-boxes with simple repeatable textfield and save for example post links, which holds information about players. But it&#8217;s hard to do this for every match.<br />
So, is there a way to show metabox with a dropdown list, which holds terms from another post type taxonomy (teams) and checkboxes with posts in this term (players). I think this is the easiest way to pick teams and players for every match.</p>
<p>P.S. If this can be implemented in other way, I will be very appriciated for advice.  </p>
