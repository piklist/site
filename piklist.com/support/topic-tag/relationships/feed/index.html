										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m trying to build this kind of query:<br />
www.levipe.be/shop/?color=white&amp;region=Bordeaux</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created a couple of CPTs:<br />
&#8211; grapes<br />
&#8211; regions<br />
&#8211; &#8230;<br />
and a couple of custom fields in my products (using WooCommerce) like<br />
&#8211; color</p>
<p>The code goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>function get_levipe_filter_posts( $query ) {

    if( is_admin() ) {
        return;
    };

    $meta_query = $query-&gt;get(&#039;meta_query&#039;);

    if ( $_GET ) {
        foreach ( $_GET as $key =&gt; $value ) {
            $meta_query[] = array(
                &quot;key&quot; =&gt; $key,
                &quot;value&quot; =&gt; explode(&#039;,&#039;, $_GET[$key]),
                &quot;compare&quot; =&gt; &quot;IN&quot;
            );
        };
    };

    $meta_query[] = array( &#039;relation&#039; =&gt; &#039;AND&#039; );

    $query-&gt;set(&#039;meta_query&#039;, $meta_query);

    return;
};</code></pre>
<p>The code functions perfectly if I limit myself to custom fields.</p>
<p>It goes wrong when I want to perform the relationships. For instance, I have a relationship established between a product and regions. There the code breaks.<br />
It also doesn&#8217;t work if I use the post_id of the region.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also tried &#8220;__relate_post&#8221; as a key but that also doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now read in one of the posts on the forum that there is a relate_query function. However, I can&#8217;t seem to find some documentation to see how it works.<br />
First, could I use it in the use case? Second, how should I implement it?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Charles </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem with post to user relationships with latest piklist version 0.9.9.7.<br />
I can&#8217;t create a bi-directional relation.</p>
<p>I have two custom post types:<br />
rf_show<br />
rf_episode</p>
<p>Now there are two relationships:<br />
rf_episode to rf_show<br />
rf_episode to user</p>
<p>This is the code for the metabox for rf_episode:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
/*
Title: On Air
Post Type: rf_episode
*/

// field for related shows
piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;checkbox&#039;,
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;rf_episode_to_show&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Shows&#039;, &#039;rf&#039;),
	&#039;relate&#039; =&gt; array(
		&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
	),	
	&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; piklist(
		get_posts(array(
			&#039;post_type&#039; =&gt; &#039;rf_show&#039;,
			&#039;numberposts&#039; =&gt; -1,
			&#039;orderby&#039; =&gt; &#039;title&#039;,
			&#039;order&#039; =&gt; &#039;ASC&#039;
		)),
		array(&#039;ID&#039;, &#039;post_title&#039;)
	)
));

// field for related users
piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;checkbox&#039;,
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;rf_episode_to_user&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;DJs&#039;, &#039;rf&#039;),
	&#039;relate&#039; =&gt; array(
		&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;user&#039;
	),	
	&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; piklist(
		get_users(array(
			&#039;orderby&#039; =&gt; &#039;display_name&#039;,
			&#039;order&#039; =&gt; &#039;ASC&#039;,
        )),
		array(&#039;ID&#039;, &#039;display_name&#039;)
	)
));
</code></pre>
<p>I create an episode and select related show (id 38) and user (id 2).<br />
This is what I get (and what I expected) in the wp_postmeta table:</p>
<p>post_id		meta_key 		meta_value<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
338		rf_episode_to_show	38<br />
338		rf_episode_to_user	2<br />
38		__relate_post		338</p>
<p>There is a bi-directional relationship between post 38 (the show) and post 338 (the created episode).<br />
And there is a relation between post 338 and the user with id 2.</p>
<p>Now I expected the second part of the bi-directional relationship in the wp_usermeta table, but there is no entry. Is &#8216;scope&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;user&#8217; wrong?<br />
How to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Steffen</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to copy/modify the demo code that shows how you can use a repeater field to create related Posts/Users/Comments on the edit form of the Demo custom-post-type.</p>
<p><code>meta-boxes/field-relationship.php</code></p>
<pre><code>
  piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;group&#039;
    ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Related Posts&#039;
    ,&#039;relate&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
    )
    ,&#039;add_more&#039;=&gt; true
    ,&#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
...</code></pre>
<p>The only difference I am attempting is that I want to be able to add other custom post types (that are related to the custom post type I am editing).  I am editing a Family, and I want to be able to add Students to it.</p>
<p>The closest I got was to simply add a post-type field within the repeated form.</p>
<p><code>[&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;hidden&#039;, &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_type&#039;, &#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;student&#039;]</code></p>
<p>This actually works perfectly (post is created of correct type, relationship is intact), but only for the first entry of the repeater.</p>
<p>If I click + and fill out a second form to relate a second student to the family, nothing gets saved.</p>
<p>Any idea what I&#8217;m missing?  It seems so close to the demo that I can&#8217;t imagine this couldn&#8217;t work.</p>

	   ));</code></pre>
<p>The above code will cause duplicate relationships.</p>
<p>Also I notice that on the front-end the checkbox version of the code above works fine inside of user&#8217;s profiles, except that the system keeps saving weird meta_keys in the user _meta table that seem to be just strings of letter/numbers. I attached an image with highlighted meta_keys that were created after I added the checkbox version of the relate_post field to my user_profile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have two custom post types, Models and Products, and I need to define a one-to-many relationship so that:<br />
1. a Product references only one Model<br />
2. a Model can belong to 0..n Products</p>
<p>With such a relationship I can either show the current Model of a Product, or list all Products that match this Model.</p>
<p>From the Edit Product page I want to select a Model and save this relationship.</p>
<p>I have used &#8220;post-relate&#8221; but:<br />
&#8211; checkboxes don&#8217;t enforce the 1st rule : one can select many models &#8211; this is good for a many-to-many relationship.<br />
&#8211; radiobuttons would be a solution, but I would prefer showing a select box</p>
<p>I have used &#8216;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;select&#8217; and passed an array of Models to &#8216;choices&#8217;, but with that solution I&#8217;m losing the reciprocity of the relationship as I have no more &#8216;post_belongs&#8217;/&#8217;post_has&#8217;. The query to get all Products for a given Model gets ugly as I need to pull the meta for each Product and keep only the ones that match this Model.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to customize the &#8220;post-relate&#8221; definition to get either that checkbox UI or a select/radiobutton UI for a one-to-many relationship?</p>
<p>The problem here is that &#8220;type&#8221; which is usually used to define the kind of UI (select, checkbox..) you&#8217;ll get in the admin is here used to define a relationship.<br />
I would suggest keeping &#8220;type&#8221; for the UI type and adding a field &#8220;relationship&#8221; where one can set &#8220;many-to-many&#8221;, &#8220;many-to-one&#8221;, &#8220;one-to-one&#8221;, &#8220;one-to-many&#8221;.</p>
