										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&gt; Piklist v. 0.9.9.4<br />
&gt; WPMU 4.3.1<br />
&gt; Custom settings page with tabs, capability set to &#8220;edit_pages&#8221; and capability filter enabling non admins save fields (as shown at the bottom od this page &gt; https://piklist.com/user-guide/docs/settings-admin-page-parameters/)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up a settings page with a text field that should save text after sanitizing it with &#8220;html_class&#8221; or &#8220;file_name&#8221;. None of those actlually work. I&#8217;ve tried entering texts like &#8220;ą_- Ssś -&#8221; and they are saved without changes.</p>
<p>Next, I tried <code>type =&gt; &#039;text_field&#039;</code> and entered text &#8220;&lt;b&gt;nuasdkl&lt;/b&gt;&#8221;. No change. &lt; &amp; &gt; werent changed into entities thus this sanitization doesn&#8217;t work as well.</p>
<p>EDIT.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just chencked another settings page without tabs. At first I thought that everything works correctly (1 field was saved correctly) but then I tried to save a few fields and noticed a pattern. When I enter data in 1 field only (other ones are empty), than it&#8217;s sanitized correctly. However, when I enter data in many fields than they are saved without sanitization.</p>
<p>EDIT 2.</p>
<p>The case above isn&#8217;t always true. I&#8217;ve tried entering data into a single field again but this time it didn&#8217;t get sanitized.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>[WP 4.3.1, piklist 0.9.9.3]</p>
<p>Today I was adding sanitization rules to all the fields in my project and noticed a very peculiar behavior in editor. </p>
<p>When I add a sanitization type &#8220;wp_kses_post&#8221; (haven&#8217;t tried different) to the editor field and save the page the output in the editor looks fine but the output on the site has escaped apostrophes like &#8220;\&#8217;quote\'&#8221; or</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;a href=&quot;\&amp;quot;http://mydomain.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/10/Comp_91040683.jpg\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;\&amp;quot;size-thumbnail&quot; wp-image-37=&quot;&quot; alignleft\&quot;=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;\&amp;quot;http://mydomain.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/10/Comp_91040683-150x150.jpg\&amp;quot;&quot; alt=&quot;\&amp;quot;test\&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;\&amp;quot;150\&amp;quot;&quot; height=&quot;\&amp;quot;150\&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>After a bit of googling I&#8217;ve come across a solution. In page tempalte I have to output the code like that &gt; &#8220;wpautop( stripslashes_deep($miniPost[&#8216;content&#8217;]) )&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is it a bug, my server configuration is wrong (unlikely since content in the admin looks ok) or am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>UPDATE 1. I&#8217;ve just noticed that sanitization doesn&#8217;t work on groupped textarea &#8211; sanitization type &#8220;text field&#8221;. I haven&#8217;t tried other fields nor sanitization types but there&#8217;s a chance other fields don&#8217;t get sanitized too.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,<br />
Krzysiek (Chris)</p>

<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;donation&#039;,
	&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;,
	&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;&#039;,
	&#039;template&#039; =&gt; &#039;mcw_quantity&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Amount of Donation&#039;,
	&#039;sanitize&#039; =&gt; array(
		array(
			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
			&#039;callback&#039; =&gt; &#039;mcw_sanitize_integer&#039;,
			&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
				&#039;non_negative&#039; =&gt; true,
			),
		),
    ),
    &#039;required&#039; =&gt; false,
));
</code></pre>
<p>My callback function is: </p>
<pre><code>function mcw_sanitize_integer ( $value, $field, $options ) {   
mcw_log( &quot;got here!&quot; );
	$number = preg_match( &#039;/^[0-9]+$/&#039;, $value );
	$number = (int)$number;
	if ( isset( $options[&#039;non_negative&#039;] ) &amp;&amp; $options[&#039;non_negative&#039;] &amp;&amp; ( $number &lt; 0 ) ) {
		return &#039;0&#039;;
	} else {
		return &quot;$number&quot;;
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that the callback function never gets called. </p>
