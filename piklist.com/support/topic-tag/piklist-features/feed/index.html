										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is more of a feature request. I wish there was a way that Piklist could have a collapse button inside the metaboxes so that when a user wants to concentrate on working on a certain section inside a metabox that has other sections, he/she can easily collapse those fields that are grouped under a collapse button. It&#8217;s actually kind of similar to the way the metaboxes behave inside WordPress on a page template, but this time around, the functionality being inside the metabox itself. It would really help in building better and more organized back-end interfaces that the user can even more easily work with.</p>
