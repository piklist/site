										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was hoping someone would be able to point me in a more elegant and less brute force approach to my particular problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a numerous custom post types &#8211; all award entry forms.</li>
<li>I have five judges who need to score each entry</li>
<li>The judges must not be able to see each other&#8217;s scores</li>
<li>The number of questions changes per post type / entry</li>
</ol>
<p>At the moment I have: </p>
<p>A metabox that can only be seen by capability &#8216;judge&#8217; &#8211; which allows all five judges to see the scoring box. </p>
<p>The scorecard is a select per question (8 in this instance) which the judge then selects and updates the entry (CPT). That&#8217;s fine for one judge marking all posts. </p>
<p>But the problem comes in with 5 judges (who cannot see each other&#8217;s scores) and 12 different CPTs with different questions e.g. 5 questions, 7 questions, 9 questions</p>
<p>Which leads me to making 60 different metaboxes! </p>
<p>Which is is fine if I didn&#8217;t care about the future maintenance of the project or doing it properly.</p>
<p>I had thought to use the Comment Metabox but I can&#8217;t see a way to have anything but a text field :/</p>
<p>I&#8217;d appreciate any suggestions, thanks in advance!</p>
