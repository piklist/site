										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am trying to make a form that builds a page for a tour. It&#8217;s a travel company. Most of the fields are simple &#8211; title, price etc. But I&#8217;m stumped on the field that makes the start and end date of a tour. Most tours only have one start and end date. As in one tour &#8211; one start and end date. So that&#8217;s easy. I would just make a start field and and end field. But some tours have more start and end dates. In other words same tour with different dates. </p>
<p>I would like to have a form that asks for the two dates. A start date and an end date. And then after those two fields are filled out it asks if there is another start and end date for another tour. If yes it provides two more fields &#8211; another start and end date. Then after those are filled out it asks if there is yet another start and end date. And so on.<br />
What would be the code to do that?<br />
Or if that&#8217;s not possible then what about it asking for how many start/end dates are needed and then supplying the correct number of start/end date fields. The first option would be better so more tour dates could be added at any time.<br />
Any assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>
