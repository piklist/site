					<description><![CDATA[<p>Recent updates to Piklist have a new setting that allows JS validation to happen client side, but for some reason the classes are different depending on whether this box is checked: div#piklist_validation_error.notice.piklist-notice.error or unchecked: div#piklist_validation_error.notice.piklist-notice.piklist-notice-error Which results in the css for these not being applied evenly when displaying an error.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled Piklist just few days ago, and I was amazed on how it works well on the front end forms.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried to change how error notice and stuff looks like on the front end, but it seems the Piklist css placement on footer is going to be major obstacle for me trying to customize it.</p>
<p>I tried to manually override it with custom css, also on footer, but it seems there&#8217;s a significant lag before my custom css takes place.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&#8217;s any way to deactivate Piklist css only on front end? Thanks!</p>

I was wondering why the following two files are added to the frontend of my site: plugins/piklist/parts/js/pik.js?ver=3.5.1 plugins/piklist/parts/css/jquery-ui/jquery-ui.smoothness.css?ver=1.9.2 As far as I can see I don&#8217;t use them, nor need them. Or did I do something wrong somewhere?</p>
