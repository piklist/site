										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All sites (15) run WordPress and Plugins latest releases, php 7.1.17 and a recent MySQL. I also run Helpers at the sites and have been using Piklist &amp; Helpers for the last 4 or 5 years. The last set of 11.x releases have presented a problem and I&#8217;ve rolled back to 9.9.17 which appears to run fine without the following problems:</p>
<p>1) On one site, SO Page Builder cannot seem to load when it is selected as a tab within the page.<br />
2) On fourteen sites the Page Builder tab appears to load OK, so that access is given to the widgets, row formulations, etc. However, when the Site Origin editor is selected as a Widget it displays a funky behavior in visual mode editing (text mode is OK). The cursor remains in the upper left position as one types. Hence all the text appears as if it is backwards. I haven&#8217;t found this behavior utilizing other visual editors. When I roll back to from 11.x to 9.9.17, all is ok again.</p>
<p>It seems as if the default Piklist settings are the same in both instances. Any suggestions? </p>
