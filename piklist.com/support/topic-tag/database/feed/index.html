<p>I&#8217;ve got corrupted post_meta values due to existing array data being double serialized.</p>
<p>The error manifests in a 500 when trying to save an Event. The code dies because it has pulled a string out of the database when it expected an Array. </p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2803129/sshot-914.png" alt="my database values" /></p>
<p>If I disable Piklist, Events save correctly.</p>
<p>In browsing the issue, I read this: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/maybe_serialize#Notes</p>
<p>in includes/class-piklist-meta.php  <code>wp_save_post_revision_post_meta_serialize()</code> looks like it does a maybe_serialize on raw values from the database, and then writes them back, without first checking whether the value is already serialized. </p>
<p>@sbruner or @jasontheadams , when should this code be triggered?</p>
<p>Without a clear understanding of when this is called, I can&#8217;t be certain that this is the cause. But I&#8217;ve definitely got a conflict between Piklist 0.9.9.9+ and the Events Calendar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Piklist, thank-you for this plugin. I had actually started creating my own version of Piklist (spent a few weeks at it) when I came across your plugin while searching for help on a topic. You saved me a lot of work so thanks! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Just have a question regarding the saving of postmeta you have implemented. It&#8217;s kinda nitpicky, but just wondering about the implementation you chose for it. Whenever a page is saved, the TABLE_postmeta row is deleted and then saved rather than updated. Code is in class-piklist-form.php around row 1626 in version 0.9.4.26. This implementation increments the meta_id column for each field/field-group created using Piklist. WP Codex recommends using updata_metadata() function as it will create the md row if not existing, but update the row if exists. So just wondering why you chose to delete_metadata() first then save?</p>
<p>Even though meta_id is a bigint type in the db which is plenty for 99.99% of websites, I personally don&#8217;t like unnecessary incrementation. Did you choose this implementation because of wp revisions possibly?</p>
<p>Thanks for this great software and I hope to be a help in making it better as I am certain I will be using it for most of my future WP sites.</p>
