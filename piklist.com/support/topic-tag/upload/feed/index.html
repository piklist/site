<p>I need a mp4 file upload and file manager tool, where a member can upload large files, and large amount of files, and where I can retrieve these files from one dedicated member folder. It would be some file management system with set privileges for a set locations.</p>
<p>I am sure someone must have coded this already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WP 4.9.5<br />
Piklist 0.9.9.15</p>
<p>I had a file upload field associated with a custom post type that was working correctly in 0.9.9.12:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;,
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;_job_download&#039;,
	&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Downloadable Job Description&#039;,
	&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
		&#039;basic&#039; =&gt; true
	)
));</code></pre>
<p><strong>What I tried:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add new post</li>
<li>Click file upload &#8220;Browse&#8230;&#8221; button, choose a file</li>
<li>Save a draft of the post</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What I expected:</strong></p>
<p>I expected to see something representing the file I attached below the &#8220;Browse&#8230;&#8221; button, with the file name and a button to remove it.</p>
<p><strong>What I got:</strong></p>
<p>No indication that the file attachment was successful. With WP_DEBUG on, I get the following warnings after saving a draft, and they appear on a blank white page (no WP admin UI loads in this case):</p>
<blockquote><p>Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist.php on line 1533</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Warning: Cannot modify header information &#8211; headers already sent by (output started at /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist.php:1533) in /var/www/html/wp-admin/includes/misc.php on line 1116</p></blockquote>

<p>First of all, Piklist rocks! I&#8217;m facing with some issue on file/upload_media field.</p>
<p>1) When you delete all items from gallery, it still remains an empty string instead of NULL<br />
array(1) { [0]=&gt; string(0) &#8220;&#8221; }</p>
<p>With the basic file type, it&#8217;s work well.</p>
<p>2. You make a condition for file field based on select field. You upload some picture and then you hide the file field. All string become empty and remains there.</p>
<p>I use metaboxes on pages.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still moving along with 0.9.9.7 beta, it rocks.</p>
<p>I have a metabox with a group field that includes a file field. I&#8217;m using a custom scope for the group and all the fields. Debugging the $fields values when testing all works well as long as the file upload field uses the Media Uploader. If basic: false, that field does not show any value at all during debugging. Very strange.</p>
<p>Is this a bug, or a limitation in the basic uploader inside WP?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the whole group:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting an undefined index error for the upload field. Is there some added trick for displaying image fields on the front-end? </p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Steve</p>
<p>I updated a settings function to impose a limit of 1 file upload for the site logo as you can see in the attached.</p>
<p>However, on save, I keep getting the error &#8220;Add File must have exactly 1 items added.&#8221; even though I&#8217;ve only selected one image.</p>
<p>I checked the database and I don&#8217;t see any settings for this field so I can&#8217;t find any conflicts in the DB. </p>
<p>Prior to this, I ran into a problem when I replaced the image with another and the setting created an array on the backend. The image wasn&#8217;t displayed on the front-end given that it was referencing the first instance in the array if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the settings code:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;checkbox&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;gwfg_use_image_for_logo&#039;
    ,&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;&#039; //
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Use image for logo?&#039;
    ,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;If left unchecked, plain text will be used instead (generated from site name).&#039;
    ,&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;use-logo&#039; =&gt; &#039;Yes&#039;
    )
));

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;gwfg_site_logo&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Add File&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;
    ,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Upload your movie logo.&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    ,&#039;options&#039;          =&gt; array(
      &#039;modal_title&#039;   =&gt; __(&#039;Add File&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
      ,&#039;button&#039;       =&gt; __(&#039;Add&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
  )
  ,&#039;validate&#039;         =&gt; array(
    array(
      &#039;type&#039;          =&gt; &#039;limit&#039;
      ,&#039;options&#039;      =&gt; array(
        &#039;min&#039;         =&gt; 1
        ,&#039;max&#039;        =&gt; 1
      )
    )
  )

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I&#8217;ve just added a file upload field so I can add a custom header to certain posts.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I&#8217;ve just added a file upload field so I can add a custom header to certain posts. Here&#8217;s my code (I&#8217;m using Genesis but that doesn&#8217;t seem to (hopefully) have anything to do with the issue at hand&#8230;)</p>
<pre><code>add_action ( &#039;genesis_before_content&#039;, &#039;aadc_casestudy_header&#039; ); 

function aadc_casestudy_header() {

	$image_ids = get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, &#039;case-study-header-image&#039;);

	print_r($image_ids);
	
	echo &#039;&lt;div style=&quot;color:white;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&#039;;
	
	if ($image_ids) {
 
		foreach ($image_ids as $image)
		{
		  $myupload = get_post($image); 
		  $title = $myupload-&gt;post_title;
		  $description = $myupload-&gt;post_content;
		  $caption = $myupload-&gt;post_excerpt;
 
		  echo &#039;title:&#039; . $title;
		  echo &#039;description:&#039; . $description;
		  echo &#039;caption:&#039; . $caption;
 
		 echo &#039;&lt;img src=&quot;&#039; . wp_get_attachment_url($image) . &#039;&quot;/&gt;&#039;;
 
		  print_r($myupload); // Displays all data
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>The $image_ids variable seems to be empty even though I&#8217;ve added an image using the file upload field. </p>
<p>I added the <code>echo &#039;&lt;div style=&quot;color:white;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&#039;;</code> line to make sure the function was even working, and that white dot above the content area does indeed display. But the print_r and of course the three &#8220;echo&#8221; lines produce nothing. (See attached screen shot).</p>
<p>Hope you can point me in the right direction &#8211; or suggest something obvious I&#8217;m missing!</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
