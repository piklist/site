										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I basically have the same problem as mentioned in this topic &gt; https://piklist.com/support/topic/only-one-image-is-saved/</p>
<p>I have an upload field in a metabox for a custom post type like so:</p>
<pre><code>piklist( &#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;type&#039;     =&gt; &#039;file&#039;,
	&#039;scope&#039;    =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039;    =&gt; __( &#039;Images&#039;, &#039;sophi&#039; ),
	&#039;field&#039;    =&gt; &#039;sophi_place_gallery_photos&#039;,
	&#039;options&#039;  =&gt; array(
		&#039;modal_title&#039; =&gt; __( &#039;Add Image&#039;, &#039;sophi&#039; ),
		&#039;button&#039;      =&gt; __( &#039;Add&#039;, &#039;sophi&#039; )
	),
	&#039;validate&#039; =&gt; array(
		array(
			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;image&#039;
		)
	)
) );</code></pre>
<p>I need the field to accept any number of images that the user would want to attach. Currently, the field will only save one image at a time. I can select multiple images to add (in the modal) but after clicking on the post publish/update button, only the last image gets saved and the other images disappear.</p>
<p>I tried the same update instructions as nnovosad, i.e. the ones from here &gt;  https://piklist.com/support/topic/9-9-data-update-script-not-triggered/#post-8808<br />
I didn&#8217;t get any errors but the problem still persists.</p>
<p>This code was working fine about 2-3 weeks ago. I didn&#8217;t touch it after that and only noticed earlier this week that it stopped saving more than one image at a time.</p>
<p>I checked the db and found that there used to be multiple entries of <code>sophi_place_gallery_photos</code> (for a single custom post type) in the <code>postmeta</code> table, each with the ID of the image attachment that I had saved. Now, only one entry exists per post, even when I attempt to save multiple images at a time.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to fix this would be much much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
