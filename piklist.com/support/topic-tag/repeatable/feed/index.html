										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m developing a slideshow plugin and have incorporated piklist into the plugin itself because of the huge amount of time and code it can save me.  I have, however, run into a problem:</p>
<p>What I would like to do is create a group of repeatable meta boxes where the group contains two fields &#8211; an image upload field (that uses the media uploader) and a text field to add a url that the image will link to.</p>
<p>However, when making a file upload field that uses the media uploader, the add_more option seems to automatically turn off.  This seems to be &#8211; from what I have discovered &#8211; because the media upload field allows you to upload multiple images.  The issue I have is that I don&#8217;t see a good way to add a text field that relates to a specific image that was uploaded in order to give it a URL to link to.</p>
<p>Is there something that I am overlooking?  Or another way to accomplish what I an looking to do?  I know that I could add a field to the media meta for a user to input a URL there after they click to choose the image from the media manager, but I would rather do it the other way.  Any suggestions?</p>
