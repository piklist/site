										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve searched high and low, and could not find any reference to this on the forum. However, I may not have been using the proper phrasing to find what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I think I found a bug, though I am not sure it is exactly or entirely a Piklist bug. I have been building a contract system for a client. The project includes a large number of add-more sections, sometimes nested, and regular (not add-more) fields. What I discovered is that the add-more fields were not selectable/editable when I tried testing the system on an iPad (either with Safari or Chrome for iOS), but the regular fields worked as expected. </p>
<p>On a whim, I thought that maybe the issue has to do with the difference between mouse input and touch input. That, combined with the ability to drag add-more elements around prompted me to try disabling the draggable functionality by adding <code>,&#039;sortable&#039; =&gt; false</code> to one of the add-more groups.</p>
<p>That fixed the problem. Now, the fields in that add-more are selectable/editable. But, the group is no longer draggable/sortable.</p>
<p>So, that leaves me with a different set of questions and challenges. </p>
<ol>
<li>Is this really a Piklist bug, or is it something in WordPress, or simply an issue with any iOS or touch-input device?</li>
<li>Is there anything that can be done to allow both the dragging of the add-more sections and editing on iOS?</li>
<li>Could the sortable flag be conditional based on the user&#8217;s device (PC vs mobile device)?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would rather not turn off the ability to sort the add-more groups entirely.</p>
