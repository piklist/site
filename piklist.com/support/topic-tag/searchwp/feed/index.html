					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi I have come across that there seems to be some kind of conflict between searchwp and piklist. When I have both installed and activated the indexing done by searchwp freezes at 0%. Any idea of how this could be resolved? It&#8217;s two very good plugins I want to use. Thanks Johan</p>
