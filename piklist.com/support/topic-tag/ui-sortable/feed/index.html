										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys, tried searching for this issue both now and a while back but haven&#8217;t encountered anyone having posted about this problem.</p>
<p>Thing is, I have a meta box on a custom post type where the user can upload several attachments (see screenshot). But, when I try to remove either one of them (or both), they just re-appear once I press Update.</p>
<p>Did some debugging and the click on remove only removes the ui-sortable item, it doesn&#8217;t clear/remove the hidden input-field which piklist uses then saving and then are using as the base for building the ui-sortable list in the meta box.</p>
<p>Seems odd that someone else wouldn&#8217;t have encountered this before, which makes me questioning if I implemented it wrongly?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an extract from my metabox-code (disregard the validation-rule, doesn&#8217;t seem to work either):</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;
	,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;noas_product_attachments&#039;
	//,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;
	,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Attachment&#039;
	,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
		&#039;modal_title&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add&#039;,&#039;noas&#039;)
		,&#039;button&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add&#039;,&#039;noas&#039;)
	)
	,&#039;validate&#039; =&gt; array(
		array(
			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;limit&#039;
			,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
				&#039;min&#039; =&gt; 0
				,&#039;max&#039; =&gt; 2
			)
		)
	)
));</code></pre>
