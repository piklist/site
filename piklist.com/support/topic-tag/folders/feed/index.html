										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone,<br />
  To make my life even easier, I created a boilerplate for building WP plugins with Piklist.  It&#8217;s got the checker and directory structure.  You can get it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/michaellautman/Piklist-Plugin-Builder">here</a>.  In order to preserve the directory structure, each empty directory has a .gitignore file in it.  Once you add something to the directory, make sure to delete that file.</p>
<p>I hope you find it useful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a heads up Kevin, the windows situation (yeah, I know you love this. :-))<br />
with having piklist parts inside the theme folder doesn&#8217;t work with the latest version of piklist. </p>
<p>So I found a solution. </p>
<p>Apparently in the themes path check in class-piklist.php around lines 200 or so.<br />
The self::$paths[$_theme] produces the full theme path but adds in the folder /piklist to the end, while the $_part variable also adds /piklist to the beginning of all parts, making sure nothing loads from the themes piklist folder.</p>
<p>I removed the themes additional piklist folder from its path, and voila. Works.<br />
I changed the following:</p>
<pre><code>
        foreach (array(&#039;theme&#039;, &#039;parent-theme&#039;) as $_theme)
        {
          $spt = self::$paths[$_theme];
          $spt = substr($spt,0,strlen($spt)-8); // EDITED BY MARCUS
          if (isset($spt))
          {
            if (file_exists($spt . $_part))
            {
              $_file = $spt . $_part;
              break;
            }
          }
        }
        // d($_file);
        if (file_exists($_file))
        {
          break;
        }
</code></pre>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know if anyone else has had this problem, but I thought I&#8217;d post a solution. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not pretty but it works. </p>
<p>In class-piklist-theme.php it checks to see if there is a theme with a folder of piklist inside it.<br />
If so, it creates a class variable:<br />
<code>self::$paths[&#039;theme&#039;]</code> </p>
<p>In class-piklist.php it checks for that theme variable, and if it finds it, sets up the files to be loaded for any (file/fields/meta-boxes) stored in that path. </p>
<p>The problem is, the $_part variable (the actual file) (which sits on line 165 and 168 of class-piklist.php) that piklist will append to the self::$paths[&#8216;theme&#8217;] variable has a path thats all screwed up. (including adding a double &#8216;/piklist&#8217; path to the beginning)</p>
<p>This is probably because my localhost site is kept on dropbox and I use a symbolic link to the dropbox folder. (checking the paths throughout piklist showed that there were often two folder paths to a file. The hardlink (c:\html\blahblabh) and the symlink (c:/html/dropbox)</p>
<p>So to fix this problem, and I hope this helps someone else, even if its only Kevin, &lt;grin&gt; I did the following:<br />
On line 175 of class-piklist.php I changed it from:</p>
<pre><code>      if (isset(self::$paths[&#039;theme&#039;]))
      {
        if (file_exists(self::$paths[&#039;theme&#039;] . $_part))
        {
          $_file = self::$paths[&#039;theme&#039;] . $_part;
        }
      }
</code></pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre><code>      if (isset(self::$paths[&#039;theme&#039;]))
      {
        $together = (stristr($_part, &#039;:\\&#039;) || stristr($_part, &#039;:/&#039;) )?$_part:str_replace(&#039;/piklist&#039;,&#039;&#039;,self::$paths[&#039;theme&#039;]) . $_part;
        if (file_exists($together))
        {
          $_file = $together;
        }
      }
</code></pre>
<p>This allows me to keep all my piklist meta-boxes (and other piklist files) in my themes directory while still using dropbox and symlinks.</p>
