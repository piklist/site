										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey All &#8211; I love that this and PODS are free.  I really enjoy being able to dig into something to see if it fits my workflow, but once I know a tool is a right fit, I am very adamant about playing fair.  We plan to use this tool as part of our client projects, and wish to buy into premium support early on.  So, my questions are:</p>
<p>1. What kind of premium addons do you envision Piklist building in house<br />
2. Are their thoughts of creating integrations with badass tools like Woocommerce and GravityForms<br />
3. Will you offer premium support for agencies like us?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
