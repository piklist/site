										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress multisite with Piklist 0.9.9.11 (network activated) and a custom made plugin which creates custom taxonomy and custom post type (network activated as well). Whenever custom post type is either created or edited there&#8217;s an admin error saying:</p>
<p><code>Undefined index: order in &quot;XXXXXX/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist.php&quot;, line 2007</code></p>
<p>On a side note, there&#8217;s a clause at the line #2007 (class-piklist.php):</p>
<pre><code>
if( ! isset( $a[ &#039;args&#039; ][ &#039;order&#039; ] ) &amp;&amp; ! isset ($b[ &#039;args&#039; ][ &#039;order&#039; ] ) )</code></pre>
<p>&#8230; but somehow I think it should be:</p>
<p><code>if( ! isset( $a[ &#039;args&#039; ][ &#039;order&#039; ] ) || ! isset ($b[ &#039;args&#039; ][ &#039;order&#039; ] ) )</code></p>
<p>&#8230;because if either of these two evaluates true then the function itself returns error &#8211; an undefined index &#8216;order&#8217;.</p>
<p>Piklist welcome back, hopefully you live again but not as a zombie plugin <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had working widgets before updating to Piklist 0.9.4.29, but then even though they show up in the widgets admin as before, they would not output to display. I noticed that the Piklist demo widgets did output and the only difference I could find is the demo widgets did have widget settings files, while my custom widgets only had output files.</p>
<p>I put a widget settings file in place for one of my custom widgets and then they all started showing up, even after I later deleted that widget settings file. Piklist seemed to need a widget settings once in order to jog my custom widgets back to displaying.</p>
<p>So that made me wonder if the <a href="https://piklist.com/user-guide/docs/file-structure/widget/" target="_blank">Piklist widget documentation</a> needs adjustment, specifically where it says about the widget output file: &#8220;This is the only required file for widgets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe this is an issue one runs into only if one&#8217;s widgets were developed before Piklist 0.9.4.29.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I have two checkbox fields. The first is a list of filters, and the second are users. My goal is to have the list of users filtered by authorship of page and/or post. So if the &#8216;post&#8217; checkbox is checked in the first field, then the users listed who are the post_author of at least one post; if the &#8216;page&#8217; checkbox is checked, then users who have authors pages. But it&#8217;s also possible to have both checked.</p>
<p>I believe the update condition supports multiple values, however I&#8217;d need the update to be the result of a function that filters the second field based off the values of the first.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
