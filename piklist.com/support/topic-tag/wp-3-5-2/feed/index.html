										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been working with Piklist in WP 3.5.2 for a few days now, and I think I&#8217;ve found another new bug. (this may or may not be 3.5.2 only, but I think it is, as I didn&#8217;t see it in previous installs)</p>
<p>When you go to the media library and edit any attachment, the following error comes up below:<br />
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6016351</p>
<p>Once I deactivate piklist the error goes away, and piklist is the only plugin in my install.</p>
<p>I tried to debug it, but finding where its coming from is hard. Maybe a new syntax in 3.5.2 for a command in the way plugins are handled in the media functions??? </p>
<p>It does state its in the foreach of the includes/media.php (wp media library file) line 1348</p>
<p>With no real way to debug it, as it doesn&#8217;t reference any of the piklist commands or files, I can only hope Steve or Kevin can figure this one out. Or maybe the Beta test replaces it. &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks guys.</p>
