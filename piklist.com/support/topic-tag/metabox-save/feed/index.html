										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having a very strange issue with meta fields not saving.  In fact, I cannot get any Piklist data to save.  Even stranger (or maybe not), the demos will not even activate.</p>
<p>I downloaded the production site to my dev environment.  Piklist was still running 0.9.4.31 which is prior to this major release update, to avoid code updates:</p>
<blockquote data-secret="OrxA2y9TfM" class="wp-embedded-content"><p><a href="https://piklist.com/2016/06/09/piklist-v0-9-9-8-coming-need-know/">Piklist v0.9.9.8 is coming: What you need to know.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://piklist.com/2016/06/09/piklist-v0-9-9-8-coming-need-know/embed/#?secret=OrxA2y9TfM" data-secret="OrxA2y9TfM" width="500" height="282" title="&#8220;Piklist v0.9.9.8 is coming: What you need to know.&#8221; &#8212; Piklist" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>After review, workflows were not used in this piklist functionality, but add_more&#8217;s were.  In Dev environment I took the following actions:</p>
<p>+ Update all plugins in local dev and confirm same issue occurs<br />
+ Update Piklist and run update script for major version update<br />
+ Disable all plugins with exception of piklist and theme where piklist files are present and verified same issue still occurs<br />
+ Enable wp_debug logging and display features but no errors are presented<br />
+ Noticed even built in piklist demos could not be activated<br />
+ Spin up fresh wordpress site and install only piklist 0.99 (latest version) and install only theme with piklist files.  Verified that custom piklist meta fields save successfully this route.  </p>
<p>This tells me code is good but some other issue presents itself conflicting with piklist in current site.  The fact that it happens with all plugins disabled, but functions properly in a fresh site makes me nervous on pin pointing the issue in production.</p>
<p>Thanks for any input!</p>
