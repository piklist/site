										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we are building a site that a lot of admin settings and post types built with Piklist. We starting experiencing issues with saving data, we can change text or check a box, save, and it goes back to its previous state even though it says its properly saved.  One of my developers looked into it and came up with this:</p>
<p><em>When rendering a form, PikList will create a WordPress Transient that identifies a particular instance of the form. When saving a post PikList will attempt to retrieve this transient. The Redis object cache doesn&#8217;t appear to support transients completely. When PikList tries to retrieve the transient the transient is simply not returned by the object cache. </p>
<p>Looking at the object cache code everything looks ok. PikList code appears to be setting/retrieving transients correctly.</em></p>
<p>So, has this come up before and if so how can we get this to work with our Redis cache?</p>
