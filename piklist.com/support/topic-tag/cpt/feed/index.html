										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I recently use piklist for my big project, and this plugin is very good, but I have some issue when I create two plugin with piklist after that I create custom post type for those two separately  use filter `piklist_post_types for both plugin one of custom post type do not create it, only the first one I made successfully create the other one is not. I do not know what I made it wrong is it because those filter only can be use once even we create two different plugin. (Sorry for my english). I hope there is a solution for this.</p>

The problem with this (I just discovered) is that unless I put it into the &#8220;support&#8221; array in the register post type command, it will NOT show in the REST response. Any idea how to include it in the REST response without displaying it (now a second time and out of order) in my CPT admin edit screen?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to be able to create a Dashboard QuickPress/Add New Post widget equivalent for a CPT that I have created with Piklist.</p>
<p>From the looks of it I&#8217;ll need to create a <code>forms/</code> part for the form, and use a shortcode in a <code>dashboard/</code> part to load it. Is this correct?</p>
<p>I essentially want it to be handled in the same way as a standard Add New post submission where it submits to <code>post-new.php</code>, only from a widget, which means I&#8217;ll need the standard hidden fields that are populated on the standard form (ie. nonce, user-id, post-author etc). Is there a quick way to build these or do I need invoke <code>field()</code> for each?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten as far as:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Action: post-new.php
Capability: edit_posts
Network: false
*/

piklist( &#039;field&#039;, array(
  &#039;type&#039;    =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
  &#039;field&#039;   =&gt; &#039;post_title&#039;,
  &#039;scope&#039;   =&gt; &#039;post&#039;,
  &#039;label&#039;   =&gt; &#039;Title&#039;
) );

&lt;the same custom fields I have in my CPT metaboxes&gt;

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
  &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;submit&#039;,
  &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;submit&#039;,
  &#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;Submit&#039;
));</code></pre>
<p>My apologies if I have missed the documentation for this somewhere.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>It seems that Piklist breaks oEmbed (e.g.: in the media uploader modal) when you edit a post from a CPT. All the things seem ok when you do the same thing from a &#8220;builtin&#8221; post type.</p>
<p>After some investigations, it seems that the <code>wp.media.view</code> cannot pick up the post ID (<code>wp.media.view.settings.post.id</code> is egal to 0) and it fails the ajax method <code>wp_ajax_parse_embed</code>.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
