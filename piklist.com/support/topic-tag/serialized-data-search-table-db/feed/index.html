										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I made a first attempt to customize the backend of my client&#8217;s site using another approach I discovered, the &#8220;WPAlchemy PHP Class&#8221;. I&#8217;d set up my metabox and all of the required fields, checkboxes and dropdowns and was feeling pretty good&#8230; when I learned that search plugins would not work with my data! </p>
<p>Why? Because the way the custom fields were being written to the DB were as &#8220;serialized&#8221; data, i.e. all my custom keys/values were written into just two WP DB fields. (Specifically, in the wp_postmeta table, in &#8220;_custom_meta&#8221; and &#8220;_custom_checkbox_meta&#8221;.)  And although it&#8217;s doable, WP apparently isn&#8217;t really optimized to work with or search this kind of data.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve since discovered Piklist, and I&#8217;m hoping it will allow the use of a &#8220;more powerful WP search&#8221; plugin like Relevanssi.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a newbie (wrangling a little PHP and JavaScript doesn&#8217;t deter me) but am still very much on the coder learning curve (heck, I just learned what serialized data was two days ago!), so I&#8217;m hopeful that Piklist will allow me to do what I need&#8230; but before I start wrapping my head around it too deeply, I wanted to check on this point as it&#8217;s pretty important if the site is going to function as my client (and I) would like it to. </p>
<p>Piklist looks pretty awesome and I&#8217;m really excited to add it to my arsenal&#8230; so looking forward to your reply. Thanks!</p>
