										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&gt; Piklist v. 0.9.9.4<br />
&gt; WPMU 4.3.1<br />
&gt; Custom settings page with tabs, capability set to &#8220;edit_pages&#8221; and capability filter enabling non admins save fields (as shown at the bottom od this page &gt; https://piklist.com/user-guide/docs/settings-admin-page-parameters/)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up a settings page with a text field that should save text after sanitizing it with &#8220;html_class&#8221; or &#8220;file_name&#8221;. None of those actlually work. I&#8217;ve tried entering texts like &#8220;ą_- Ssś -&#8221; and they are saved without changes.</p>
<p>Next, I tried <code>type =&gt; &#039;text_field&#039;</code> and entered text &#8220;&lt;b&gt;nuasdkl&lt;/b&gt;&#8221;. No change. &lt; &amp; &gt; werent changed into entities thus this sanitization doesn&#8217;t work as well.</p>
<p>EDIT.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just chencked another settings page without tabs. At first I thought that everything works correctly (1 field was saved correctly) but then I tried to save a few fields and noticed a pattern. When I enter data in 1 field only (other ones are empty), than it&#8217;s sanitized correctly. However, when I enter data in many fields than they are saved without sanitization.</p>
<p>EDIT 2.</p>
<p>The case above isn&#8217;t always true. I&#8217;ve tried entering data into a single field again but this time it didn&#8217;t get sanitized.</p>
