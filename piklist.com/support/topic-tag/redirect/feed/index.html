										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,<br />
To workaround an issue I am redirecting the user back to the normal view of a CPT after they submit changes to it via FEF.</p>
<p>I have achieved this using the <strong>piklist_request_field</strong> filter, but wonder what other ways the community might suggest this could be done more efficiently.<br />
It also relies on the <em>Redirect:</em> comment block directive &#8211; if this is removed, my code doesn&#8217;t get called.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my code:</p>
<pre><code>//
//	Alter the Redirect link for Edit Listing form
//
add_filter( &#039;piklist_request_field&#039;, &#039;thearr_request_field&#039; );
function thearr_request_field( $field )
{
        // only interested in the redirect field
	if ( strcmp(&#039;redirect&#039;, $field[&#039;field&#039;]) === 0 )
	{
                // this is what tells the FEF which data to use
		if ( isset( $_REQUEST[&#039;_post&#039;][&#039;ID&#039;] ) )
		{
			// change redirection back to the normal view after edit
			$field[&#039;value&#039;] = get_permalink( $_REQUEST[&#039;_post&#039;][&#039;ID&#039;] );
		}
	}

	return $field;
}</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a front-end form (tickets purchase) that was working fine with beta 0.9.5v but I ran into several problems with 0.9.9. I have been able to resolve all but this. I have been using a redirect field in the comment block at the top of the file. Initially this was set to &#8220;review_url&#8221; as I couldn&#8217;t put a function in the Redirect field: </p>
<p>In <code>piklist/parts/ticket-order-form.php</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/*  
Title: Ticket Order Form
Method: post
Message: Data saved as a post of type ticket.
Redirect: review_url
*/</code></pre>
<p>In <code>functions.php</code>:</p>
<pre><code>add_filter( &#039;piklist_add_part&#039;, &#039;mcw_form_redirect&#039;, 10, 2 );
function mcw_form_redirect ( $data, $type ) {
	// if not a form then bail
	if ( $type != &#039;form&#039; ) {
		return $data;
	}
	// check if any page template is set in the comment block
	if ( ( $data[&#039;redirect&#039;] ) == &#039;review_url&#039; ) {
		$data[&#039;redirect&#039;] = home_url( &#039;/tickets/order-review/&#039; );
	}
	return $data;
}</code></pre>
<p>After upgrading to 0.9.9.6, it tried to send me to <code>http://mysite.com/review_url</code> which of course was 404. I changed the Redirect field: </p>
<pre><code>/*  
Title: Ticket Order Form
Method: post
Message: Data saved as a post of type ticket.
Redirect: /tickets/order-review/
*/</code></pre>
<p>Now it sends me to the correct page, but doesn&#8217;t pass the $_REQUEST parameters so I can&#8217;t process the form inputs. </p>
<p>Is Redirect no longer supported? Is there another way to do this? </p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Donna</p>
