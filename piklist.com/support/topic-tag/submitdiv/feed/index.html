										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have this beautiful new Publish box that I created, and it worked only when Piklist Demos was active. This happen on my dev environment, and in messing around, I got it to work by changing the name of the file while Piklist Demos were active, It then worked when I deactivated the demos.</p>
<p>When I pushed the changes up to staging I have the same issue again and changing the name doesn&#8217;t resolve it (likely it&#8217;s not the thing that resolved it before, it just happened to coincide with whatever else I did that actually solved it.)</p>
<p>WP Multisite 4.8.1<br />
Piklist 9.9.12</p>
<p>So, in staging, the custom Publish box works consistently while Piklist Demos are active, and goes back to the default publish box when Piklist Demos are deactivated.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my header block:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Publish
Extend: submitdiv
Extend Method: replace
Context: side
Priority: core
Post Type: pro-cards
*/</code></pre>
