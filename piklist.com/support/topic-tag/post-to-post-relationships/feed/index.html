<p>However, I&#8217;m not using the wp admin for linking the posts themselves. I need to use a custom built angualrJs app that manages a lot of wp admin functionality via the wp rest api. </p>
<p>I will set up the relationships via piklist but what would be the best way of going about exposing the ability to link posts to other posts via the rest API? </p>
<p>Would I just need to create a new endpoint for each CPT? I&#8217;ve never created one so if you have any suggestions on it the best approach, I&#8217;d appreciate it. </p>
<p>I realize this is out of scope of your support but thought I&#8217;d ask for a general direction to get me started. </p>
<p>Thanks again for everything~</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have created a &#8216;Tests&#8217; CPT using Piklist. I need a way to include the contents of a specific &#8216;Test&#8217; on a specific page. To do this I have created a metabox that shows up on all pages &#8211; the idea is to allow the user to be able to choose from a select box which &#8216;Test&#8217; they would like to show on that page.</p>
<p>I am assuming that the user would be able to choose the &#8216;Test&#8217; by name, however, when I then use <code>get_post_meta()</code> in the template part I shall be including, I would somehow need to pass a post id.</p>
<p>Any idea on how this can be accomplished using Piklist? I read a bit about post-to-post relationships, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s what I need.</p>
<p>Additionally, I found an interesting thread by @Jason (https://piklist.com/support/topic/post-relate-select-dropdown/) on what I think is something similar, however, I&#8217;m not sure how this would work in my scenario.</p>
<p>Any input/ideas would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>Ian</p>
