										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re currently using 0.9.9.13 I just want you to be aware that if you view the <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/releases">releases on Github</a> you&#8217;ll now see 0.10 Beta 1. This is the same exact release, we only changed the version.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because the difference between 0.9.9.12 and 0.10 is somewhat significant. There were considerable portions of code that were rewritten and optimized, fixing many of the bugs experienced. To better communicate this we bumped to 0.10. Also, since we haven&#8217;t released this on WordPress.org this is still considered a beta, which we greatly appreciate your testing, although we believe it&#8217;s even more solid than 0.9.9.12.</p>
<p>Please continue to test it out and make <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/issues">issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/pulls">pull requests</a> so we can make it&#8217;s final release as solid as possible.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping to make Piklist even better! It&#8217;s a community effort!</p>
