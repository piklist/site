										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I have a fairly complicated site built atop Piklist. I have been storing repeating groups of (add more) data (in the postmeta table) along with the custom post types I have built. And I need a more reliable way than index to get at these groups for editing and updating. I would have liked to have used grouped fields (serialized in the db), but because my groupings have many conditional values, this won&#8217;t currently work in Piklist (<a href="https://piklist.com/support/topic/grouped-conditionals-not-working/">see this link</a>).</p>
<p>So here are my questions to solve this:<br />
1. Could I store these groups in their own post type and relate them to the parent CPT?<br />
2. If so, is there a way to allow these child posts to both display AND be editable from within the parent in admin?</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice or help!</p>
