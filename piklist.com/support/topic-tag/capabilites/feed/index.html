					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello Does Piklist allow the admin menu to be edited, to hide page, post, etc.? Does Piklist allow the user roles to be edited, to change or remove editor, author, etc.? Does Piklist allow different menu items to be shown dependent on the user role? Or asked another way, How does piklist.com achieve this functionality? [&#8230;]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello</p>
<p>Does Piklist allow the admin menu to be edited, to hide page, post, etc.?<br />
Does Piklist allow the user roles to be edited, to change or remove editor, author, etc.?<br />
Does Piklist allow different menu items to be shown dependent on the user role?</p>
<p>Or asked another way, How does piklist.com achieve this functionality?</p>
<p>For example, I have logged in to type this question, but at no point have I seen the WordPress backend. I have seen a completely custom &#8220;My Account&#8221; page. Is that possible with Piklist? If not, how did you achieve this?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>few user fields, i would to read only for user (subscriber, contributor, author )<br />
and full with admin.</p>
<p>example: admin want to add sms credit to user fields: sms credit,<br />
in admin login fields should be normal as admin can put value to add etc.</p>
<p>and when user login , he will see only that fields as readonly, which display his credit.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
