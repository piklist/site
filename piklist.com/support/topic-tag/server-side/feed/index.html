										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, Folks!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to use Piklist and it&#8217;s awesome, but I have a question: is there any plans for integrating some sort of client-side validation to the fields created using the framework? As far as I know, there is server-side validation, which works ok, but I think that it would be most practical add to a client-side one too. This way, you don&#8217;t need to save/update a post and wait for a page reload to check if it&#8217;s everything ok.</p>
<p>Or there is at least a way to add a custom client-side validation?</p>
<p>Thanks for any answer or help!</p>
