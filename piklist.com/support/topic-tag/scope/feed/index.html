					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I saw a post from 2016 that said that, at some point, piklist is going to allow saving to a custom table by setting the scope on a piklist field. Is that completed yet? If so, are there docs on it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,<br />
I&#8217;m new to Piklist, working on a simple plugin that creates a custom post with a couple of custom admin fields. An answer to this field determines whether another field appears on a public comment form.</p>
<p><strong>Admin side</strong><br />
Custom post type: Question, using the title field to write the question.<br />
Custom admin only field: &#8220;response_type&#8221; (radio box with a few options)</p>
<p><strong>Public</strong> comment form field: &#8220;response&#8221; (whether it&#8217;s yes or no, a rating, etc should be determined by the custom field in Question).</p>
<p>When I have conditional fields appear in the same file, they work as expected. In the case above, the response_type is in the metabox file with other Question related fields and only appears in admin. The conditional field appears in a separate comment_form-metabox.php file and when they are apart, they don&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>I found the post at the link below and thought the solution was adding scope to the conditions array and tried numerous scope combinations.<br />
https://piklist.com/support/topic/conditional-fields-not-working-when-scope-is-different/</p>
<p>Example appears in question-metabox.php</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;radio&#039;,
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;response_type&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Response Type&#039;,
	&#039;help&#039; =&gt; &#039;This is help text.&#039;,
	&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;,
	&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; array(
		&#039;yn&#039; =&gt; &#039;Yes or No&#039;,
		&#039;ad&#039; =&gt; &#039;Agree or Disagree&#039;,
		&#039;Rating1toX&#039; =&gt; &#039;Rating: 1 to X&#039;,
		&#039;RatingXto0toX&#039; =&gt; &#039;Rating: -X to 0 to X&#039;
	),
	&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;yn&#039;,
	&#039;required&#039;   =&gt; true
));</code></pre>
<p>Example appears in public facing comment_form_metabox.php</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
		&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;radio&#039;,
		&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;response&#039;,
		&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Response&#039;,
		&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;comment_meta&#039;,
		&#039;list&#039; =&gt; false,
		&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; array(
			&#039;Yes&#039; =&gt; &#039;Yes&#039;,
			&#039;No&#039; =&gt; &#039;No&#039;
		),
		&#039;conditions&#039; =&gt; array(
   			array(
   			&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;,
    		&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;response_type&#039;,
    		&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;yn&#039;
   			))
   		));
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully, it&#8217;s easily fixed. I don&#8217;t discount the possibility I&#8217;ve misunderstood something and/or have been staring at this too long to see the obvious.</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br />
Morgan</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still moving along with 0.9.9.7 beta, it rocks.</p>
<p>I have a metabox with a group field that includes a file field. I&#8217;m using a custom scope for the group and all the fields. Debugging the $fields values when testing all works well as long as the file upload field uses the Media Uploader. If basic: false, that field does not show any value at all during debugging. Very strange.</p>
<p>Is this a bug, or a limitation in the basic uploader inside WP?</p>

        ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add File(s)&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    	,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;You can add image files or zip file with all images in it.&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    	,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
      		&#039;basic&#039; =&gt; true
    		)
        )
      )
    )
  );

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;submit&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;submit&#039;
    ,&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;Submit&#039;
  ));
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I have used scope as &#8220;shop_order&#8221; , that I think is the post type for order in woocommerce, ref https://docs.woothemes.com/document/installed-taxonomies-post-types/</p>
<p>Now to display it on order detail page I am adding this code in woocommerce/order/order-details.php</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php 
		// Additional attachement display on detail page
		$upload_order_attch = get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, &#039;upload_order_attch&#039;, true);
		// Get your custom template part: addmore-workout-template.php
		piklist(get_stylesheet_directory() . &#039;/template/addmore-workout-template&#039;, array(&#039;data&#039; =&gt; $upload_order_attch, &#039;loop&#039; =&gt; &#039;data&#039;));
	?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>According to the instruction provided in your documentation. and then created a template file addmore-workout-template.php and added this code in it </p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php 
	echo $data[&#039;upload_order_attch&#039;]; 
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>But nothing is displaying on the order detail page when creating an order by adding images to piklist add more field.</p>
<p>Please suggest me what I am missing and what next we need to do here to make it available on the order detail page?</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In all of my custom post types I can no longer change or select a taxonomy. It shows me what was selected before the upgrade, but I can no longer modify the seletions. When I click save, it says saved correctly, but it never actually saves the new selection. In one I have check box as the option, and the other is a select field.</p>
<p>Did the scope method change in the upgrade?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;checkbox&#039;
    ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;taxonomy&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;trip-type&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Trip Type&#039;
    ,&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; piklist(
      get_terms(&#039;trip-type&#039;, array(
        &#039;hide_empty&#039; =&gt; false
      ))
      ,array(
        &#039;term_id&#039;
        ,&#039;name&#039;
      )
    )
  ));</code></pre>
<p>Here is my created Taxonomy from my main plugin file:</p>
<pre><code>$taxonomies[] = array(
      &#039;post_type&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_mission_trip&#039;
      ,&#039;name&#039; =&gt; &#039;trip-type&#039;
      ,&#039;show_admin_column&#039; =&gt; true
      ,&#039;hide_meta_box&#039; =&gt; false
      ,&#039;configuration&#039; =&gt; array(
        &#039;hierarchical&#039; =&gt; false
        ,&#039;labels&#039; =&gt; piklist(&#039;taxonomy_labels&#039;, &#039;Trip Type&#039;)
        ,&#039;show_ui&#039; =&gt; true
        ,&#039;query_var&#039; =&gt; true
        ,&#039;rewrite&#039; =&gt; array( 
          &#039;slug&#039; =&gt; &#039;trip-type&#039; 
        )
      )
    );</code></pre>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I&#8217;d like to include an extra Editor field for adding a certain category of information to posts.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! I&#8217;d like to include an extra Editor field for adding a certain category of information to posts. But I can&#8217;t figure out how to display it&#8230; and it looks like there might be a typo on the user guide page for this field type (?).</p>
<p>The first example given is:</p>
<p><code>echo wpautop(get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, &#039;field_name, true));</code></p>
<p>However I notice a single quote mark before field_name in the above code, which I presume is an error (and indeed throws a PHP error if I try it).</p>
<p>However when I substitute my field name, and remove the quote mark, I get the error message:</p>
<p>Use of undefined constant awards &#8211; assumed &#8216;awards&#8217; in /home2/vjffs122/public_html/wordpress/wp-content/themes/genesis-sample/single-event.php on line 67</p>
<p>Am I approaching this the wrong way?</p>
