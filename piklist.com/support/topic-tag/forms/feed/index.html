I am not quite sure what approach to take with Piklist to define my form inside a metabox. Should this be an HTML field? Some combo of field types? Where should the form logic live?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just tested the demo text fields in the<em> demo settings</em> pages to see if there&#8217;s some sort of limit to how much can be entered into a single field and found that there&#8217;s none. Personally, I&#8217;d love to control how much a user can enter into any given field as a safe guard. I wouldn&#8217;t want a user to enter 200 characters into text field where I expect him/her to enter just about 15 characters. For example, I have text field for the Headline and I don&#8217;t want the user to enter more than 25 characters into this field, is there a way I can do this with Piklist? I don&#8217;t seem find it in the validation and field parameters tutorials in the documentation. Any help is highly appreciated.</p>
