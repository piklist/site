										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while back I made a decision store my grouped field data as individual fields (instead of a serialized array), and now I am not sure if that decision was the right one. Can someone comment on whether adding grouped fields in the admin (ignore the front end for now) is more or less efficient (and faster or slower) than if they are serialized? I have an area for adding grouped fields, and there are about 15 different types of group to add, each with their own fields. I have noticed as I have added to this list that the interface has gotten quite slow when clicking on the plus button to add another group to a record. Could this be made any faster if I were to switch to storing the group as a serialized array? OR is there something else that could speed up the interface? With fewer grouped field arrays, it used to take only a second or two to add another, now the interface lags two to three seconds, which is not great. Any ideas?</p>

<p><code>add_filter( &#039;show_post_locked_dialog&#039;, &#039;__return_false&#039; );</code></p>
<p>which gives a warning but allows us both to view the same post. But I don&#8217;t want it to be a permanent change and sometimes forget to disable the filter when we&#8217;re done. It would be nice to have an option to set/unset the filter, and to have an admin banner warning whenever it&#8217;s set. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to write something like this for myself but figured it might also be a useful addition to WP Helpers. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,<br />
just patched to 0.9.9.9 on a dev site, and now the widgets.php admin doesn&#8217;t load&#8230; the footer scripts are being output in an infinite loop. Kill the page load and the js never activates the editor, so widget editing is broken. Commenting out the single line below, from lines 292-309 of  <code>includes/class-piklist-form.php</code> allows the page to load properly.</p>
<pre><code>
       if (in_array($pagenow, array(&#039;widgets.php&#039;, &#039;customize.php&#039;)))
    {
      if (!class_exists(&#039;_WP_Editors&#039;))
      {
        require(ABSPATH . WPINC . &#039;/class-wp-editor.php&#039;);
      }

      if ($pagenow == &#039;widgets.php&#039;)
      {
        add_action(&#039;admin_print_footer_scripts&#039;, array(&#039;_WP_Editors&#039;, &#039;editor_js&#039;), 50);
  //     add_action(&#039;admin_footer&#039;, array(&#039;piklist_form&#039;, &#039;editor_proxy&#039;));
      }
      else
      {
        add_action(&#039;customize_controls_print_footer_scripts&#039;, array(&#039;_WP_Editors&#039;, &#039;editor_js&#039;), 50);
        add_action(&#039;customize_controls_print_footer_scripts&#039;, array(&#039;piklist_form&#039;, &#039;editor_proxy&#039;));

<p>Any ideas?<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my challenge.  When you look at Piklist&#8217;s demo settings page under the lists&#8217; tab, it has controls well organized with the title field you describe in the comment block beautifully introducing and categorizing the controls. Refer to the attached image. These titles seem to be separate individual settings files fully populated with the desired fields, that are all called on one page by simply assigning them to that particular tab in the comment block. At least that is how I&#8217;ve been able to replicate that behavior on my side.  The challenge here, at least in my case is that the last created settings file is the one that shows up at the top of all other settings on that particular tab. Is there a way to determine the order in which the output of these settings files shows up on their respective tab? Take for example in the attached image, suppose I wanted to make the  <em>Checkbox Fields</em> section show first at the top, then <em>Select Fields</em> section next and lastly the <em>Multiselect Fields</em> section. How would I go about that? I don&#8217;t seem to find it anywhere in the Piklist documentation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of research and have narrowed it down to you and wp-types toolset. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m experimenting on a a multi tenancy project similar to squarespace or wix but for a niche market. </p>
<p>The idea being that someone can login, pick from our design templates, edit settings, create pages, products (and other custom post types we make) manage their account with us and interact with other members on the platform. Then, the frontend of their site uses whatever theme they selected and shows all the content they created. </p>
<p>The kicker is, this all happens on their same domain. In fact, it&#8217;s just how wordpress works with /wp-admin but we don&#8217;t anyone going into the wp-admin. We need to build our own.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m working with Multisite for the multi-tenancy aspect of the app. </p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m still not sure what to do about the custom admin. I was thinking of just doing some sort of theme switching based on role where if they&#8217;re login to their domain, we show them our custom theme and if they&#8217;re logged out, they see the front-end theme. </p>
<p>Can picklist help with building out the admin pages to manage all the settings, pages, media, comments etc as well as managing visibility so I can keep people out of the wp-admin?</p>
<p>If so, how would we handle admin navigation in a central place so we don&#8217;t have to manage on every single subsite?</p>
<p>Also, is there any way to share a global set of taxonomies amongst different post types and user profiles? If I have the term &#8220;awesome&#8221; on my profile (which I am) and another post has the term &#8220;awesome&#8221;, can I search by &#8220;awesome&#8221; and return all results?</p>
<p>Lot&#8217;s of questions, I know. But I&#8217;m awesome and so are you. </p>
