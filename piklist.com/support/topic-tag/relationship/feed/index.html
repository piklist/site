										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have decided to use Piklist for a project instead of ACF, specifically for the post to post relationship capabilities but using the built in Piklist Demos, the relationship function is not working as expected. </p>
<p>When creating a <strong>new</strong> Demo Post, in the Relate &gt; Advanced Tab, I can create new related posts from using the Related Posts form, I can create as many as I want. However if I then publish and <strong>edit</strong> the Demo Post, I cannot add any more related posts, only edit the ones that already exist. </p>
<p>As an aside, I also experienced this issue using my own CPT, so I then tested it with the built in demos.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello !<br />
I discoved relationships page, and it seems amazing, What a good idea!<br />
I have 2 questions about that :</p>
<p>If I select a few posts in my admin page, how could I display in front, the title, and the url link to these posts?</p>
<p>Last question, and I think it could be a hard one : I have a multilangue website (with polylang), so the admin page show me all posts 3 times (for my 3 translations). How could I do to have just posts in the actual language? I think it&#8217;s too complexe&#8230;</p>
<p>Thank you a lot for your answer, and really, good job with piklist, I love it !</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just discovered Piklist and it is really great and basically the thing I was searching for &#8211; giving me the features of plugins like ACF but still the flexibility of PHP code.<br />
Let&#8217;s hope Piklist will be further developed and maintained for a long, long time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I want a repeating/loop/&#8221;add more&#8221; field with items that each have a post-relate field.</p>
<p>I tried the following code (how sleek and beautiful Piklist code is!)</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Test
Post Type: parent-post
*/

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
  &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;group&#039;
  ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;items&#039;
  ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Items&#039;
  ,&#039;add_more&#039; =&gt; true
  ,&#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
    array(
      &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;
      ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;field-1&#039;
      ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Field 1&#039;
      ,&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;&#039;
    )
    ,array(
      &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;post-relate&#039;
      ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
      ,&#039;template&#039; =&gt; &#039;field&#039;
    )
  )
));
</code></pre>
<p>While the normal text field is in each &#8220;add more&#8221; item, the post-relate field is shown only once below all the &#8220;add more&#8221; items.<br />
What could be wrong with the code above &#8211; how can I have a post-relate field per &#8220;add more&#8221; item?</p>
<p>I also attached a screenshot.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and<br />
with best regards</p>

<p>We have been given a requirement to create a new CPT (lets call it a review that will be used to review standard WordPress posts).</p>
<p>With Piklist would it be possible:</p>
<p>&#8211; to give the CPT a one-to-one relationship with a WordPress post at the time of creating each new review CPT?</p>
<p>&#8211; or would there be another way to ensure that only a single review of each WordPress post could be made i.e. if a WordPress post has already been reviewed then users are blocked / do not see the option to add another review?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

                )
            ),

            )
        )
    )
);
</code></pre>
<p>This way it saves the ID of the related posts as a post meta.</p>
