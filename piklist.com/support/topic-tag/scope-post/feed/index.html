										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have an event post type. Some events are small; others are annual events and warrant their own pages. So I have a select field for events that enables the user to choose the page associated with an event. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done this before with post_meta and had no problem. But this time, because the events aren&#8217;t hierarchical, I decided to use post_parent to store the page ID. What I found is that I could set the post_parent to have a specific page value, but that I couldn&#8217;t set it to zero. </p>
<p>When the value is stored in post_meta, there&#8217;s no problem setting it back to zero. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the code: </p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
/*
Title: Page Test
Description: select page for event
Post Type: event
Priority: high
Order: 20
*/

// get an array of page titles indexed by page IDs
$default_page = array( 0 =&gt; &#039;-- none --&#039; );
$choices = $default_page + piklist(
	get_posts( array(
		&#039;post_type&#039; =&gt; &#039;page&#039;,
		&#039;numberposts&#039; =&gt; -1,
		&#039;orderby&#039; =&gt; &#039;title&#039;,
		&#039;order&#039; =&gt; &#039;ASC&#039;
	)),
	array( &#039;ID&#039;, &#039;post_title&#039; )
);

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;event_page&#039;,
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;select&#039;,
	&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Event Page (stored in post_meta)&#039;,
	&#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;If there is a special page for this event, select it here.&#039;,
	&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; $choices,
));

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_parent&#039;,
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;select&#039;,
	&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Event Page (stored in post_parent)&#039;,
	&#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;If there is a special page for this event, select it here.&#039;,
	&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; $choices,
));
</code></pre>
<p>Not surprisingly, behavior is the same for radio buttons. </p>
<p>HTH,<br />
