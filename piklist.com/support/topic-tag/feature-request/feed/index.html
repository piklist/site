										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is more of a feature request. I wish there was a way that Piklist could have a collapse button inside the metaboxes so that when a user wants to concentrate on working on a certain section inside a metabox that has other sections, he/she can easily collapse those fields that are grouped under a collapse button. It&#8217;s actually kind of similar to the way the metaboxes behave inside WordPress on a page template, but this time around, the functionality being inside the metabox itself. It would really help in building better and more organized back-end interfaces that the user can even more easily work with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys,<br />
First of, thanks a lot for a great plugin. I just started to use it and I love it!! It&#8217;s so flexible and easy to use. AWESOME. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>As I&#8217;m working on a project that uses piklist, I&#8217;ve found the necessity to add classes to metaboxes.<br />
I&#8217;ve seen you use the filter <code>postbox_classes_{post_type_name}_{metabox_id}</code> to add classes already, but it would be great to be able to add some in the meta_field headers:</p>
<pre><code>
/*
Title: Meta title
Post Type: post
Order: 200
Lock: true
Class: my-class my-otherclass
*/
</code></pre>
<p>It would allow to target specific boxes with JS and css without using IDs&#8230;<br />
Would you consider this feature? </p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Marc.</p>

<p>I could, of course, simply ignore the button, but I&#8217;m still stuck with the overlying form. I would literally want a blank page (title at the top is fine). Think this could become a part of the core?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Is there a way to add a own custom field to a metabox?</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code> piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;my_custom_field&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;My own custom Field&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;myCustomField&#039;
    ,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;My own html field.&#039;
  ));

add_action( &#039;piklist_render_my_custom_field&#039;, &#039;my_custom_field_function&#039;, 10, 2 );
function my_custom_field_function( $field, $meta ) {
	return &#039;&lt;label for=&quot;&#039; . $field[&#039;id&#039;] . &#039;&quot;&gt;&#039; . $field[&#039;label&#039;] . &#039;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;&#039; . $field[&#039;id&#039;] . &#039;&quot; value=&quot;&#039; . $meta . &#039;&quot; /&gt;&#039;;
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a simple example, I want to build a field that use a table with pagination, something my customer want and will be great if I can use piklist to do that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

When making a metabox, for example, the post types are listed in the &#8220;Post Type&#8221; meta of the comments, and the values are taken literally.</p>
<p>It would be great to have a constant syntax, something like:<br />
<code>Post Type: {PROJECT_TYPE}, {ANOTHER_TYPE}</code></p>
