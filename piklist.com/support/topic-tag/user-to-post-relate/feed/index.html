					<description><![CDATA[<p>I scoured the forums but couldn&#8217;t find anything definitive. Is it possible to relate a user to a post (without making them the author)? If so, how is it done? I couldn&#8217;t find any tutorial in the docs but saw a few things on it like this: https://piklist.com/support/topic/post-to-user-relationships/ I tried : &#60;?php /* Title: Post [&#8230;]</p>

<p>If so, how is it done? I couldn&#8217;t find any tutorial in the docs but saw a few things on it like this: https://piklist.com/support/topic/post-to-user-relationships/</p>
<p>I tried :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
/*
Title: Post Relate
Post Type: 
*/

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;post-relate&#039;
    ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;user&#039;
    
    ,&#039;template&#039; =&gt; &#039;field&#039;
  ));
  
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>but that doesn&#8217;t work. I also tried using user_meta in the scope but it&#8217;s not working. Any help is appreciated.</p>
