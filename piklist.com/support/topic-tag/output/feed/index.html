										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had working widgets before updating to Piklist 0.9.4.29, but then even though they show up in the widgets admin as before, they would not output to display. I noticed that the Piklist demo widgets did output and the only difference I could find is the demo widgets did have widget settings files, while my custom widgets only had output files.</p>
<p>I put a widget settings file in place for one of my custom widgets and then they all started showing up, even after I later deleted that widget settings file. Piklist seemed to need a widget settings once in order to jog my custom widgets back to displaying.</p>
<p>So that made me wonder if the <a href="https://piklist.com/user-guide/docs/file-structure/widget/" target="_blank">Piklist widget documentation</a> needs adjustment, specifically where it says about the widget output file: &#8220;This is the only required file for widgets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe this is an issue one runs into only if one&#8217;s widgets were developed before Piklist 0.9.4.29.</p>
