<p>I want to save that title to a an extra hidden field with the linebreaks as html tags. I know how to do that, but how do I pull the custom title field to the hidden? Do I need to hook into &#8216;piklist_save_field&#8217;? I would love to have it as a part of a the sanitization filter that I am already using to strip out extra spaces on the &#8216;custom_title&#8217;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys, long time since I&#8217;ve posted.<br />
Hopefully you can help. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a client who&#8217;s been using piklist since 2013, and the site and software I created has worked great for 5 years, but recently they reached out to me as something stopped working. </p>
<p>They are using WordPress: 4.2.9<br />
And piklist: 0.9.5m</p>
<p>Up until April 18th of this year, they were using WordPress 4.2.1</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem. The piklist hook &#8216;piklist_save_field&#8217; was working up until April 18th.<br />
But now it doesn&#8217;t fire on publishes or updates.<br />
In fact, the piklist function &#8216;process_form&#8217;, doesn&#8217;t fire on publishes or saves either.<br />
Even &#8216;template_redirect&#8217; which is attached to process_form, doesn&#8217;t seem to fire either.</p>
<p>Actions like: wp_insert_post_data aren&#8217;t interfering. (disabled them to see)</p>
<p>And I can&#8217;t find what has changed that would affect this. </p>
<p>Is there some way I can debug this? Any suggestions?<br />
I have two requests for debugging from the client. </p>
<p>They don&#8217;t want to upgrade their wordpress, as this one has been secured and all holes fixed. (so they don&#8217;t want to have to secure it again with a newer version) and they don&#8217;t want to upgrade piklist too much (at my suggestion) as they don&#8217;t want to have to redevelop a lot of functions that used old piklist code. (they aren&#8217;t budgeting for this, and I&#8217;m not a free-well of coding. And it was developed with a really old version of piklist, and hey it worked non-stop for 5 years) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Pre-thanks.</p>
<p>Marcus</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the scenario. I&#8217;m building a simple system to manage church families. I have two CPT: contacts and households.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using a check box on the contact CPT to indicate whether a new household CPT should be created for the contact. This is used if the household isn&#8217;t already in existence. I&#8217;ve hooked into <code>piklist_save_field</code> to look for the checkbox and create the household.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m not sure how to relate the contact to the newly created household. Can you point me in the right direction?</p>
