										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Imagine I have to Custom Post Types:  Courses &amp; Lessons.  I create a new course and have a custom repeater field called Lessons.  I add a number of lessons and hit Save (or Update).  What I want to then happen is that under the Custom Post Type for Lessons there are new entries &#8211; each one with the title that I entered on the Course page.</p>
<p>Is this possible?  If so, any idea how?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Moshe</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have been given a requirement to create a new CPT (lets call it a review that will be used to review standard WordPress posts).</p>
<p>With Piklist would it be possible:</p>
<p>&#8211; to give the CPT a one-to-one relationship with a WordPress post at the time of creating each new review CPT?</p>
<p>&#8211; or would there be another way to ensure that only a single review of each WordPress post could be made i.e. if a WordPress post has already been reviewed then users are blocked / do not see the option to add another review?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>    I am very new to WordPress development and Piklist and trying to build a system for my company to manage quotes, jobs and reporting on transport services. The aim is also to allow customers and partners manage, update and review their own quotes, jobs etc. As we will have multiple customers and partners it is vital that only their quotes etc. created by them is viewable and editable by them once they login. There is probably a very easy way to do this but I&#8217;ve been searching in vain and hoping I&#8217;ll get the answer here.</p>
<p>    Essentially &#8211; restrict actions on Custom Post Types to the user who created them initially and back office staff for management of the same.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Karen </p>
