Thanks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very new to wordpress (trying to make my first theme) and i&#8217;m using piklist.</p>
<p>I created several custom post types The one i&#8217;m trying to create now  has icon it, what I&#8217;d like to do is create a dropdown select to choose the icon for the posts inside that custom post type. The icons are from font awesome, they are not images it&#8217;s something like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-paint-brush&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code></p>
<p>I could cho the second class name but it wouldn&#8217;t be very user friendly when viewed as an option.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to do is to make option 1: &#8220;Paint Brush&#8221; and then perhaps and if statement that would output &#8220;fa-paint-brush&#8221; if option1 = &#8220;Paint Brush&#8221;, though i&#8217;m not sure if this is very effective or even where should i put the if statements.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
