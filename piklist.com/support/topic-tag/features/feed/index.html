										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is more of a feature request. I wish there was a way that Piklist could have a collapse button inside the metaboxes so that when a user wants to concentrate on working on a certain section inside a metabox that has other sections, he/she can easily collapse those fields that are grouped under a collapse button. It&#8217;s actually kind of similar to the way the metaboxes behave inside WordPress on a page template, but this time around, the functionality being inside the metabox itself. It would really help in building better and more organized back-end interfaces that the user can even more easily work with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First congratulation for Piklist, I feel it will be a very great tool for WordPress development.</p>
<p>I activate the plugin 0.6.1 with a 3.4.1 version of WP and this is my feedback:</p>
<p>&#8211; If the debug constant is set to true in the config.php file, there are lot of notices (undefined index, undefined constant, deprecated &#8220;get_theme_data&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8211; The features I expect for futur releases are :<br />
1- Possibility to reorder CPT by drag and drop<br />
2- Possibility to reorder Field group by drag and drop<br />
3- Possibility to have multiple Wysiwyg Editor on the same page, for instance one in each Field Group if you use add_more<br />
4- A WP media uploader field/bouton with thumb preview and a delete icon<br />
5- Add an update/save buton in each module to avoid scrolling on the top of the page</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a fan user of WPAlchemy from Dimas and Options Framework from Devin, but Piklist seems very promising, i could become a fan user of Picklist <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Thanks for your job</p>
