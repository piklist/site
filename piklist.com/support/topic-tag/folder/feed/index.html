										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, I&#8217;ve got a small but relatively important issue that came up. </p>
<p>I am slowly converting all the theme work I&#8217;ve done for this current client into plugins, including piklist.<br />
When I moved my meta-boxes out of the piklist/parts/meta-boxes folder and moved them into my plugin folder /addons/mae-registrations/parts/meta-boxes the boxes show up, but none of the fields do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming this is because piklist doesn&#8217;t like the fact i&#8217;m not using /plugins/ as the plugin folder name, and rather using /addons/<br />
But wanted to know if you or anyone else for that matter is having the same problems, and if you/they have a solution. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t urgent, but it does allow me to make the process of updating the multisites easier when they are plugins. Short-term I just moved them back to the piklist folder.</p>
<p>Thanks guys.</p>
<p>Marcus</p>
