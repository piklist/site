										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It seems that if I create a new (custom) post (using a front-end piklist form), the post is saved with all the meta-data that I specify in the form, but the same meta-data is not persisted in the initial revision that WP generates. Once I update the data from the admin UI, I see a diff between revision 1 and 2 where all the custom metadata fields are set. Eg:</p>
<p>Create new post, id 100. WP saves a revision, id 101. I update one of the fields (foo), save post. WP updates id 100, and creates a new revision, id 102. If I diff revision 101 and 102 in the admin UI, I would expect a diff for only the <code>foo</code> field, but I see that every meta field in the post goes from undefined/blank to the initial values that they had when first creating the post. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I noticed Piklist_Revision hooks into save_post and saves metadata for new revisions, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any guard for which fields are saves, so I end up with changes to _edit_last, _edit_lock, _post_restored_from, etc in my revision diffs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed <code>Piklist_Revision</code> hooks into save_post and saves metadata for new revisions, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any guard for which fields are saves, so I end up with changes to <code>_edit_last</code>, <code>_edit_lock</code>, <code>_post_restored_from</code>, etc in my revision diffs. </p>
<p>Perhaps piklist should go the way of e.g. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-post-meta-revisions/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-post-meta-revisions/</a> and only save a white-listed list of meta fields, possibly defaulted to the ones defined by the piklist-generated meta-boxes of that post type?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also seeing that all my meta-data fields are cleared when WP does an auto-save, is there a particular reason for the <code>!wp_is_post_autosave($post_id)</code> condition in <code>save_post()</code>?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Piklist, thank-you for this plugin. I had actually started creating my own version of Piklist (spent a few weeks at it) when I came across your plugin while searching for help on a topic. You saved me a lot of work so thanks! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Just have a question regarding the saving of postmeta you have implemented. It&#8217;s kinda nitpicky, but just wondering about the implementation you chose for it. Whenever a page is saved, the TABLE_postmeta row is deleted and then saved rather than updated. Code is in class-piklist-form.php around row 1626 in version 0.9.4.26. This implementation increments the meta_id column for each field/field-group created using Piklist. WP Codex recommends using updata_metadata() function as it will create the md row if not existing, but update the row if exists. So just wondering why you chose to delete_metadata() first then save?</p>
<p>Even though meta_id is a bigint type in the db which is plenty for 99.99% of websites, I personally don&#8217;t like unnecessary incrementation. Did you choose this implementation because of wp revisions possibly?</p>
<p>Thanks for this great software and I hope to be a help in making it better as I am certain I will be using it for most of my future WP sites.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have a variable, created and populated inside the &#8220;publish_hour&#8221; (hour is my CPT) hook. I&#8217;ve been trying to save that variable to a metadata field, however, it seems that the data does get stored but get&#8217;s overwritten by a blank (I assume this is the value from the input box). Is there any way that I can prevent the data being overwritten?</p>
<p>From what I have observed, the hook &#8220;publish_hour&#8221; gets fired twice, as when I added &#8220;wp_die();&#8221; the data was not overwritten.</p>
