										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed that the field conditions don&#8217;t work, when they depend on hidden field&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>The situation is, I have a plugin, which I am writing a settings page for. The Workflow has multiple tabs, the first tab allows the user to enable/disable this plugin by clicking a checkbox field called &#8220;enabled&#8221;. And since I couldn&#8217;t find a way to directly &#8220;hook&#8221; into the &#8220;enabled&#8221; field from other workflow tabs, I was thinking to use a hidden field and populate the value of this field dynamically on every page load. This is what I had:</p>
<pre><code>$plugin_settings = get_option( &#039;plugin_settings&#039; );

piklist( &#039;field&#039;, array(
  &#039;type&#039;  =&gt; &#039;hidden&#039;,
  &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;is_enabled&#039;,
  &#039;value&#039; =&gt; ( array_key_exists( &#039;enabled&#039;, $plugin_settings ) &amp;&amp; $plugin_settings[&#039;enabled&#039;] == &#039;true&#039; ),
) );
piklist( &#039;field&#039;, array(
  &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
  &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;dependent_field&#039;,
  &#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Dependent Field&#039;,
  &#039;conditions&#039; =&gt; array(
    array(
      &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;is_enabled&#039;,
      &#039;value&#039; =&gt; true,
      &#039;reset&#039; =&gt; false,
    ),
  ),
));</code></pre>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t work. It only works, if the &#8220;is_enabled&#8221; is not of type &#8220;hidden&#8221;. Is this a bug or an expected behaviour?</p>
<p>Also, does anyone know how else I can hide fields based on other filed&#8217;s value from another workflow tab? Or, even better, how can I hide entire Wokflow tabs, based on Setting field value?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alex</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m having a really hard time to get my settings tabbed pages to work. I&#8217;ve tried using workflows and as well without them but nothing seems to work. I&#8217;ve already created my settings pages and populated them with fields. These settings pages and their tabs were working fine until I upgraded to the latest version of 0.9.9.9. I&#8217;ve created the tabs using the old method i.e., without using workflows and they seem to work; but only with one problem. When I use two or more words separated by space, it changes the name to a single word in sentence case joining the two words with an underscore. Now this is not the most challenging since I can choose to use only one word for the tab name. The actual problem however is that metaboxes themselves and fields on the settings pages designated to show on particular don&#8217;t show up at all. Using the workflows worsens the problem as that makes even the tabs disappear altogether. I&#8217;ve been stuck with this problem for the last two or so weeks. I feel  I&#8217;m burning out. Does somebody there no how I can make this work?</p>
<p>I have this code in one of my settings files named <em>footer-settings.php</em>:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Footer Setting
setting: libra_custom_settings
Tab: Footer
*/</code></pre>
<p>I have this code in another settings file named <em>basic-settings.php</em>:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Basic
Setting: libra_custom_settings
*/</code></pre>
<p>I have this code in my <em>functions.php</em> file:</p>
<pre><code>add_filter(&#039;piklist_admin_pages&#039;, &#039;piklist_theme_setting_pages&#039;);
  function piklist_theme_setting_pages($pages)
  {
     $pages[] = array(
      &#039;page_title&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Libra Settings&#039;)
      ,&#039;menu_title&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Theme Settings&#039;, &#039;piklist&#039;)
      ,&#039;sub_menu&#039; =&gt; &#039;themes.php&#039; //Under Appearance menu
      ,&#039;capability&#039; =&gt; &#039;manage_options&#039;
      ,&#039;menu_slug&#039; =&gt; &#039;libra_custom_settings&#039;
      ,&#039;setting&#039; =&gt; &#039;my_theme_settings&#039;
      ,&#039;menu_icon&#039; =&gt; plugins_url(&#039;piklist/parts/img/piklist-icon.png&#039;)
      ,&#039;page_icon&#039; =&gt; plugins_url(&#039;piklist/parts/img/piklist-page-icon-32.png&#039;)
      ,&#039;single_line&#039; =&gt; true
      ,&#039;default_tab&#039; =&gt; &#039;Basic&#039;
      ,&#039;save_text&#039; =&gt; &#039;Save Demo Settings&#039;
    );
 
    return $pages;
  }</code></pre>
<p>I have this code in the comment block of another settings file that displays the General tab:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Component visibility Settings Section
setting: lawyeah_custom_settings
Tab: General
*/</code></pre>
<p>I have this code in the comment block of another settings file that displays the Social Options tab:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Social Media Settings
Setting: libra_custom_settings
Tab: Social-Options
*/</code></pre>
<p>I wonder what exactly I&#8217;m doing wrong. The attached snip shows what I already have with everything as it is right now. Any help is very much appreciated. Thanks</p>
