										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to make an advanced search form with FacetWP according to custom fields (and custom post types) created with Piklist (and stored in wp_postmeta).<br />
But it seems to be hard for both plugins to cohabit.</p>
<p>Is someone already tried to run FacetWP with Piklist ?</p>
<p>Apparently, FacetWP recommands Advanced Custom Fields plugin but I would like to keep Piklist because :<br />
1- I should change everything on my website<br />
2- I love piklist</p>
<p>Thank you !</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Appreciate the docs needed a workover in the lead up to 1.0, but I&#8217;m finding it really frustrating the there&#8217;s no *documentation* index; instead we get a mishmash of tutorial and doc code. I want to cut to the chase, and just read the API docs, but I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s all mixed in now, and search is really inconsistent.</p>
<p>This page:</p>
<p>https://piklist.com/learn/doc/</p>
<p>redirects back to the top of the &#8216;learn&#8217; section &#8211; surely it should be an index for the core docs?</p>
<p>I stumbling into a page like this:</p>
<blockquote data-secret="0KlbbsgfjE" class="wp-embedded-content"><p><a href="https://piklist.com/learn/doc/settings/">Settings Section [File Structure]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://piklist.com/learn/doc/settings/embed/#?secret=0KlbbsgfjE" data-secret="0KlbbsgfjE" width="500" height="282" title="&#8220;Settings Section [File Structure]&#8221; &#8212; Learn Piklist" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>with a title like:<br />
Settings Section [File Structure]</p>
<p>And think, ok, it looks like there are a number of [File Structure] pages. put &#8216;file structure&#8217; into search, and&#8230; no results. </p>

I feel difficult to retrieve the information, the search field is only to search the title of the post. I would like to locate the post looking for information in any field. On my system the posts are private, so the location of the records is always done on the back end.</p>
