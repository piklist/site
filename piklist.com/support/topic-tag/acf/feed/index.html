										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to some problems with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), I&#8217;m starting to convert several sites from ACF to Piklist. With simple fields the translation is straightforward, and some sites are small enough to just manually create the new data. But I do have a few sites with large amounts of the repeater data, so I&#8217;m planning to use a script. Has anyone out there already created such a script that you&#8217;d like to share? Or who is starting the process and would be interested in collaboration? </p>

<p>Quick question.. everything I see in regards to conditionals it for admin-pages, what about for frontend. For example, below.. I can check to see if the user added data to the field, if so, it shows on front end, if not code does not display. Love to see a sample or two on how to do this. </p>
<p>1) basic if and<br />
2) an if/else statements</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php if( get_field(&#039;image&#039;) ): ?&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;&lt;?php the_field(&#039;image&#039;); ?&gt;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>* no rush on this. I just looked around the User Guide, and searched forums and seems to be limited info on displaying on front end. Thanks in advance!</p>
