										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hullo there, I&#8217;m running Piklist 0.9.9.9. I had tabs working earlier in version 0.9.4.31 however now the are not. Well, I&#8217;ve tried re-doing the entire thing since I already had my settings files but still they don&#8217;t appear even though I follow the documentation step-by-step to make it happen. I&#8217;ve tried removing all tab related parameters from the comment block of all settings files and only left them on two as the documentation directs but still the tabs won&#8217;t appear. All that Piklist does is to show all my settings fields on the same long page instead of place each setting file under a defined tab. What do I do about this coz I&#8217;m I&#8217;ve failed to make it work even with the documentation. In addition to that, even the demo won&#8217;t disable. When I go the Piklist menu &gt; Addons and then click on the disable button and then click &#8216;<em>Save settings</em>&#8216;, nothing happens. The disable button does not change state to show activate and simply remains as it were with the demos still active and the notice that says <em>&#8220;Piklist Demos are activated.<br />
Demos should only be used as a resource, and turned off during normal website operation.&#8221; still shows. What do I do for these problems?</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have admin setting page, which have different tabs. It worked well with old version but when i update to beta version 0.9.9.2, Tabs not working. </p>
<p>I tried with the documentation provided in other ticket for same but still not working. Let me know step by step procedure on how i can make it right. Below is a files and folder structure for same</p>
<p>My Plugin<br />
/inc<br />
  wp-hr-pages.php &#8211; it have code which adds custom setting page<br />
/parts<br />
  /settings<br />
     general-tab.php &#8211; tab fields for setting page<br />
     advance-tab.php &#8211; tab fields for setting page<br />
  /workflows<br />
     page-settings.php &#8211; main workflow header file<br />
     general-tab.php &#8211; tab declaration for workflow<br />
     advance-tab.php &#8211; tab declaration for workflow</p>
<p>Let me know if there is anything wrong in it. I think there is quite less documentation on how to build setting stuff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, i&#8217;m trying to create a tabbed settings page for an Open Source plugin i&#8217;m creating:<br />
https://github.com/tripflex/user-activate-by-reset</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where admin page is created:<br />
https://github.com/tripflex/user-activate-by-reset/blob/master/options.php#L51</p>
<p>But it seems that a &#8220;General&#8221; tab keeps showing up even though I don&#8217;t have any files in the settings folder that have a &#8220;General&#8221; tab.  I even tried setting the default tab to one of the other ones, or even &#8220;General&#8221; and when &#8220;General&#8221; it just creates another tab saying &#8220;General&#8221;</p>
<p>I just tried testing it again and it seems the &#8220;Default Tab&#8221; is creating a blank tab even if it already exists, just tried using &#8220;Style&#8221; and now it shows two style tabs:</p>

<p>Any thoughts, ideas, or suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
