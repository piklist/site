					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello. I&#8217;d like to create several CPTs at the network level in a 2-site multisite network where each site shares the data from those CPTs. Is this possible with Piklist? I know it works because I&#8217;ve seen WPMU DEV&#8217;s Custom Fields plugin do it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I&#8217;m trying to make the plugin work on a multisite with child themes where every site in the network has it&#8217;s own child theme. Piklist is enabled globally throughout the network. Where do I put the piklist folder with my custom fields files? I tried every variation but it still doesn&#8217;t work. Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Is there a way to add relationships between CPTs? For example: A CPT &#8216;customer&#8217; would have a &#8216;has_many&#8217; relationship with a CPT &#8216;order&#8217;. I swear I saw this functionality mentioned somewhere with Piklist. I guess I need to spend some time in the source code as its the ultimate manual.</p>
