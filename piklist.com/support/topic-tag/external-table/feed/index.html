										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am new to piklist i used pods alot.</p>
<p>I have a table of movies with several details and fields.<br />
what i want to do is auto create a wordpress site based on this.<br />
And i want to keep this table for advanced search with a plugin i wrote myself.</p>
<p>1- Is there a way to auto create custom fields and post type based on this pre created database table?<br />
2- Is it possible insert a post into this custom table?</p>
<p>Any ideas</p>
<p>PS: I managed this with pods but i lost performance and lost in coding mostly because of the lack repeater fields and template integration.</p>
