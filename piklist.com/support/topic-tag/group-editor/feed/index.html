										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi and thanks for a very useable plugin!</p>
<p>I have defined a repeatable group of fields, that contains one subheader (of type text input) and one subbody (of type editor). When editing a post and clicking plus to add a new group of subheader+subbody, a new group with plus and minus buttons appear as expected, but the subbody editor does not render (see screenshot).</p>
<p>When saving, reloading or loading a post, everything seems to render correctly, even if you previously added an editor that was not seen in the editor.</p>
<p>This has worked as expected before, I think &#8211; but I&#8217;m not sure &#8211; that this behaviour changed after my upgrade to WordPress version 4.3. I have tried earlier versions of Piklist in the current WP 4.3 setup but that doesn&#8217;t help. The bug persists in all themes I have tried.</p>
<p>This is my fields declaration code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
/*
Title: Content blocks
Post Type: blocks-type-here
*/

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
  &#039;type&#039;     =&gt; &#039;group&#039;,
  &#039;field&#039;    =&gt; &#039;content-blocks&#039;,
  &#039;label&#039;    =&gt; &#039;Content blocks&#039;,
  &#039;add_more&#039; =&gt; true,
  &#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
    array(
      &#039;type&#039;  =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
      &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;subheader&#039;,
      &#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Subheader&#039;,
    ),
    array(
      &#039;type&#039;  =&gt; &#039;editor&#039;,
      &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;subbody&#039;,
      &#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Enter some contents here&#039;,
    ),
  ),
));</code></pre>
<p>Is this a known bug or am I missing something?</p>
