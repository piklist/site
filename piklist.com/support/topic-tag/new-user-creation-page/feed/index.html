										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>first: Piklist is a great tool!!</p>
<p>Actually i work on a client project with an custom Partner-Management. I tried out different plugins like Members, WP-Members and so on, but nothing was the right plugin for the project.</p>
<p>Piklist seems to be the right base for the whole project and for building all the future features we have planned&#8230;</p>
<p>Two questions at the start:<br />
1: is it possible with piklist to add custom fields to the user profile? Because in the docs there are just tutorials for custom post types.</p>
<p>2: All Partners, with the basic informations, will be registered by an admin. And we need unique Partner-Numbers within two groups: Partner and Customer. So the idea is, that a new partner gets a number like P123456 and a new customer a number like C123456. But we don&#8217;t want to give the numbers per hand. Is it possible to give this numbers automatic for new partners and new customers?<br />
All, partner and customer, are &#8220;Users&#8221; with different registration and different roles and capabilities&#8230; We need this to manage future features.</p>
<p>Many thnx for your support in advanced,<br />
Roland</p>
