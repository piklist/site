<p>What users need to be able to do is disable the transparent revisioning of post meta values, as required, as sometimes, piklist&#8217;s versioning is in conflict with other plugins trying to do the same thing; in the case of the Events Calendar, even with the latest code optimisation to do this by a raw sql query, metadata is duplicated, because the Events Calendar is performing an analogous action.</p>
<p><code>remove_action(&#039;save_post&#039;, array(&#039;piklist_revision&#039;, &#039;save_post&#039;), -1);</code></p>
<p>is a brute-force way to disable it, globally, but what flow-on effects does this have on Piklist&#8217;s behaviour? There is scant documentation on this feature, it&#8217;s sitting in the background with the potential for conflict.</p>
<p>Perhaps a filter to disable it on a per post type basis?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It seems that if I create a new (custom) post (using a front-end piklist form), the post is saved with all the meta-data that I specify in the form, but the same meta-data is not persisted in the initial revision that WP generates. Once I update the data from the admin UI, I see a diff between revision 1 and 2 where all the custom metadata fields are set. Eg:</p>
<p>Create new post, id 100. WP saves a revision, id 101. I update one of the fields (foo), save post. WP updates id 100, and creates a new revision, id 102. If I diff revision 101 and 102 in the admin UI, I would expect a diff for only the <code>foo</code> field, but I see that every meta field in the post goes from undefined/blank to the initial values that they had when first creating the post. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I noticed Piklist_Revision hooks into save_post and saves metadata for new revisions, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any guard for which fields are saves, so I end up with changes to _edit_last, _edit_lock, _post_restored_from, etc in my revision diffs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed <code>Piklist_Revision</code> hooks into save_post and saves metadata for new revisions, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any guard for which fields are saves, so I end up with changes to <code>_edit_last</code>, <code>_edit_lock</code>, <code>_post_restored_from</code>, etc in my revision diffs. </p>
<p>Perhaps piklist should go the way of e.g. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-post-meta-revisions/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-post-meta-revisions/</a> and only save a white-listed list of meta fields, possibly defaulted to the ones defined by the piklist-generated meta-boxes of that post type?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also seeing that all my meta-data fields are cleared when WP does an auto-save, is there a particular reason for the <code>!wp_is_post_autosave($post_id)</code> condition in <code>save_post()</code>?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Looking for help from the community on this one.  Adam Silverstein has put out a wordpress plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-post-meta-revisions/</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called wp-post-meta-revisions and it saves post meta revisions by adding custom meta field names to a simple array.  From what I can tell it is being developed to be implemented into core long-term.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a field in my custom post type &#8216;assets&#8217; labeled &#8216;asset_type&#8217;.  I implement the following code:<br />
/*Save Custom Meta for Revisions*/</p>
<p>function add_meta_keys_to_revision( $keys ) {<br />
    $keys[] = &#8216;asset_type&#8217;;<br />
    return $keys;<br />
}<br />
add_filter( &#8216;wp_post_revision_meta_keys&#8217;, &#8216;add_meta_keys_to_revision&#8217; );</p>
<p>When I look in the database I can see the entries being made successfully:<br />
176	_wp_post_revision_meta_keys	a:2:{i:0;s:10:&#8221;asset_type&#8221;;i:1;s:10:&#8221;model_type&#8221;;}</p>
<p>When I use built in revision viewer I only see the title.  Not sure if this is by design or not?  I love piklist but without a method to save revisions I&#8217;m going to have trouble bringing into my workflow.</p>
<p>FYI I&#8217;m working on an converting an intranet theme I&#8217;ve built with advanced custom fields and several other plugins to piklist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know that later down the project, I&#8217;m going to have to work with revisions and deal with all the meta data in my CPT&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I started looking through your code Kevin, and I see your using add_metadata, instead of add_post_meta which allows for revisions. But what I didn&#8217;t realize is that you are doing this for all the meta fields automatically, which will make my job, so incredibly easy later, because all I have to do is mark &#8216;supports =&gt; array( &#8216;revisions&#8217; ) to a field to make sure its being recorded with revisions. </p>
<p>Truly great coding bud. </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I was wondering if you have set it up to show the changed meta fields in the revisions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Marcus</p>
