										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to get my head round the way post to post relationships work in Piklist. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got set up currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>A jobs CPT.</li>
<li>A contacts CPT.</li>
</ul>
<p>When editing a Job I have added a field to relate it to a Contact. The Job can only belong to one Contact. The field code looks like this:</p>
<pre>
<pre><code>
piklist( &#039;field&#039;, array(
		&#039;type&#039;     =&gt; &#039;select&#039;,
		&#039;field&#039;    =&gt; &#039;related_contact&#039;,
		&#039;label&#039;    =&gt; __( &#039;Contact&#039;, &#039;core-functionality&#039; ),
		&#039;relate&#039;   =&gt; array(
			&#039;scope&#039;    =&gt; &#039;contact&#039;,
		),
		&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; array( &#039;none&#039; =&gt; __( &#039;Choose a Contact&#039;, &#039;core-functionality&#039; ) ) + piklist(
			get_posts( array(
				&#039;post_type&#039; =&gt; &#039;contact&#039;,
				&#039;numberposts&#039; =&gt; -1,
				&#039;orderby&#039; =&gt; &#039;title&#039;,
				&#039;order&#039; =&gt; &#039;ASC&#039;,
			) ),
			array( &#039;ID&#039;, &#039;post_title&#039; )
		),
	)
);
</code></pre>
<p>This seems to work fine. The ID of the contact is correctly saved in the &#8216;related_contact&#8217; field.</p>
<p>Now, when editing a Contact, I would like to pull in the list of related Jobs. However, I can&#8217;t seem to get this to work. I&#8217;ve tried it the Piklist way:</p>
<pre>
<pre><code>
$related = get_posts( array(
	&#039;post_type&#039;        =&gt; &#039;job&#039;,
	&#039;posts_per_page&#039;   =&gt; -1,
	&#039;post_belongs&#039;     =&gt; $post-&gt;ID,
	&#039;suppress_filters&#039; =&gt; false,
) );

echo var_dump( $related );
</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried this with &#8216;post_belongs&#8217; and &#8216;post_has&#8217; and in both cases $related is an empty array.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also tried it the WordPress way:</p>
<pre>
<pre><code>
$related = get_posts( array(
	&#039;post_type&#039;        =&gt; &#039;job&#039;,
	&#039;posts_per_page&#039;   =&gt; -1,
	&#039;meta_query&#039;       =&gt; array(
		array(
			&#039;key&#039;   =&gt; &#039;related_contact&#039;,
			&#039;value&#039; =&gt; $post-&gt;ID,
		),
	),
	&#039;suppress_filters&#039; =&gt; false,
) );

echo var_dump( $related );
</code></pre>
<p>But in that instance I also get an empty $related array.</p>
<p>Am I missing something here?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Dave</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I&#8217;m building a daily report divided into 3 parts: morning, afternoon and evening. Each of parts has the same set of fields including related custom posts (field names have respective suffix so they all are different). Is it possible to include the same set of related posts for each part? Thanks.</p>
