										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have some CPT relationships that need to happen and I see that piklist (in all it&#8217;s brilliance) has the ability to create these: https://piklist.com/user-guide/docs/fields/post-post-relationships/</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m not using the wp admin for linking the posts themselves. I need to use a custom built angualrJs app that manages a lot of wp admin functionality via the wp rest api. </p>
<p>I will set up the relationships via piklist but what would be the best way of going about exposing the ability to link posts to other posts via the rest API? </p>
<p>Would I just need to create a new endpoint for each CPT? I&#8217;ve never created one so if you have any suggestions on it the best approach, I&#8217;d appreciate it. </p>
<p>I realize this is out of scope of your support but thought I&#8217;d ask for a general direction to get me started. </p>
<p>Thanks again for everything~</p>
