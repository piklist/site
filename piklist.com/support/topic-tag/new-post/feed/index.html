I have a metabox with the attribute New: true.<br />
What I want is to show this on the add-new page and hide it once saved on the edit page.<br />
The case is that the metabox appears on the edit page and not on the add-new page, even when I set the attribute to false.<br />
What am I doing wrong?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have set up a nice set of Workflow tabs that require the user to go through them one by one.  The issue that I am having is that the data in a field is lost when the user clicks the next tab and the page reloads.  </p>
<p>Anyone know of a way to maintain the data in each field when a workflow tab is clicked? or is there a good way to ask the user to update the post before clicking a new tab and/or popping up a dialogue box to remind them to save that field set before moving on?</p>
<p>This may have to be done via some AJAX.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
