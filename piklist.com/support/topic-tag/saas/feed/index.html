										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of research and have narrowed it down to you and wp-types toolset. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m experimenting on a a multi tenancy project similar to squarespace or wix but for a niche market. </p>
<p>The idea being that someone can login, pick from our design templates, edit settings, create pages, products (and other custom post types we make) manage their account with us and interact with other members on the platform. Then, the frontend of their site uses whatever theme they selected and shows all the content they created. </p>
<p>The kicker is, this all happens on their same domain. In fact, it&#8217;s just how wordpress works with /wp-admin but we don&#8217;t anyone going into the wp-admin. We need to build our own.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m working with Multisite for the multi-tenancy aspect of the app. </p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m still not sure what to do about the custom admin. I was thinking of just doing some sort of theme switching based on role where if they&#8217;re login to their domain, we show them our custom theme and if they&#8217;re logged out, they see the front-end theme. </p>
<p>Can picklist help with building out the admin pages to manage all the settings, pages, media, comments etc as well as managing visibility so I can keep people out of the wp-admin?</p>
<p>If so, how would we handle admin navigation in a central place so we don&#8217;t have to manage on every single subsite?</p>
<p>Also, is there any way to share a global set of taxonomies amongst different post types and user profiles? If I have the term &#8220;awesome&#8221; on my profile (which I am) and another post has the term &#8220;awesome&#8221;, can I search by &#8220;awesome&#8221; and return all results?</p>
<p>Lot&#8217;s of questions, I know. But I&#8217;m awesome and so are you. </p>
