										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi.<br />
I have Piklist installed on my Multisite Network and when I turn debug mode on in wp-config.php I get this Warning:<br />
<strong>Notice: Undefined offset: 1 in /wp-includes/post.php line 1336</strong><br />
If I deactivate Piklist, the warning goes away.<br />
I am using WordPress v. 4.5.2 and Piklist v. 0.9.9.8<br />
I have no idea of what the cause of this warning could be. Maybe you guys have?</p>

<p>When I try and update any other plugin, i get these warnings, on a blank white pages in addition to the notices. (it still does activate the plugin, but i have to refresh the page)</p>

<p>I did not have any of these errors or notices until I recently updated the plugin via the wordpress automatic updater.</p>
