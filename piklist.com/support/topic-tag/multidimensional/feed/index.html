										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m fairly new to Piklist and WordPress.  I have an issue that is giving me a headache.  I have a created a content type via Piklist for staff.  Within this content type I have two fields that I would like to loop over when displaying the content.  The first is the organizational level for the staff member (are they a department head, director, or plain staff).  The second loop would sort each organizational level by last name.  </p>
<p>I am able to do this using array_multisort();.  Is this the best method?  Is there a better way in WordPress that I am missing?  How can I get WordPress to see the custom fields I have created?  I tried meta_key and key, neither worked.  When I use WP_query, I get strange results.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.  Sorry for the newbie question!</p>
<p>Lynn</p>
