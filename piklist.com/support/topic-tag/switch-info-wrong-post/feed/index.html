										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys, this might be a bug in 0.9.4. Just spoke to my client and here is what&#8217;s happening (based on his info and my interpretation): after making a change to one post, it&#8217;s now showing all the metafield info from another post! This is not just a display issue, the info on the backend is wrong (it&#8217;s a duplicate of the other post&#8217;s). </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine that anything my client did would cause this &#8211; he edited the post that now shows the wrong info but only changed a couple of items, nothing unusual at all.</p>
<p>I tried using the Revisions feature to roll back the change &#8211; not being sure if Piklist would be included in that function &#8211; but only got an error message:</p>
<p>Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /home/content/10/11034010/html/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist-revision.php on line 35</p>
<p>Warning: Cannot modify header information &#8211; headers already sent by (output started at /home/content/10/11034010/html/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist-revision.php:35) in /home/content/10/11034010/html/wordpress/wp-includes/pluggable.php on line 1121</p>
<p>Please help&#8230; thanks!<br />
