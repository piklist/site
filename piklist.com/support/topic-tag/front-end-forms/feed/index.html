										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am using front end forms, in which I have a number of required fields. If these fields are not filled out and the user submits the form, they receive BOTH the green success message defined in the header, as well as the red field errors list. Thankfully the form does not end up actually being submitted, but is there a way to only show the success message IF there was an actual successful submission?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for direction or insight of using front end forms to pull data from table by choices, select or whatever means to display those choices to end user. </p>
<p>I imagine using Piklist something like this:</p>
<p>I create a page in the admin to crud the data by an administrator with Piklist and then create a Piklist frontend form for my users to create a &#8220;custom product&#8221; based upon the many categories created by an admin.</p>
<p>I would also need to use conditionals to show which items can be used together from the various dropdowns on the frontend forms.</p>
<p>I would also need to use calculations on those fields to calculate size, price dimensions etc</p>
<p>First of all: 1. Is Piklist a good fit for this? 2. Can this be done with Piklist? Any issues using Piklist and writing all of this data in one table like post-meta?</p>
<p>I appreciate any and all suggestions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am working on an eCommerce site http://uniqueswebsolution.com/clippingc/ and I am using piklist beta version 0.9.9.6</p>
<p>On the order detail page I want to display a add more field of upload files. You can see the product detail page to know what I have added on the product detail page through piklist http://uniqueswebsolution.com/clippingc/product/color-correction/</p>
<p>For adding this add more field I had created order-form.php under piklist/parts/ folder of the theme and provided following code to display it.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
/*
Title: Upload files
Method: post
Message: Your data has been successfully uploaded

*/
piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;group&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;upload_order_attch&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Upload your images&#039;) 
    ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;shop_order&#039;
    ,&#039;columns&#039; =&gt; 12
    ,&#039;add_more&#039; =&gt; true
    ,&#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
      array(
        &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;
        ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;attch-single&#039;
    	,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;shop_order&#039;
        ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add File(s)&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    	,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;You can add image files or zip file with all images in it.&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    	,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
      		&#039;basic&#039; =&gt; true
    		)
        )
      )
    )
  );

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;submit&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;submit&#039;
    ,&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;Submit&#039;
  ));
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I have used scope as &#8220;shop_order&#8221; , that I think is the post type for order in woocommerce, ref https://docs.woothemes.com/document/installed-taxonomies-post-types/</p>
<p>Now to display it on order detail page I am adding this code in woocommerce/order/order-details.php</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php 
		// Additional attachement display on detail page
		$upload_order_attch = get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, &#039;upload_order_attch&#039;, true);
		// Get your custom template part: addmore-workout-template.php
		piklist(get_stylesheet_directory() . &#039;/template/addmore-workout-template&#039;, array(&#039;data&#039; =&gt; $upload_order_attch, &#039;loop&#039; =&gt; &#039;data&#039;));
	?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>According to the instruction provided in your documentation. and then created a template file addmore-workout-template.php and added this code in it </p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php 
	echo $data[&#039;upload_order_attch&#039;]; 
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>But nothing is displaying on the order detail page when creating an order by adding images to piklist add more field.</p>
<p>Please suggest me what I am missing and what next we need to do here to make it available on the order detail page?</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
