										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve searched high and low, and could not find any reference to this on the forum. However, I may not have been using the proper phrasing to find what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I think I found a bug, though I am not sure it is exactly or entirely a Piklist bug. I have been building a contract system for a client. The project includes a large number of add-more sections, sometimes nested, and regular (not add-more) fields. What I discovered is that the add-more fields were not selectable/editable when I tried testing the system on an iPad (either with Safari or Chrome for iOS), but the regular fields worked as expected. </p>
<p>On a whim, I thought that maybe the issue has to do with the difference between mouse input and touch input. That, combined with the ability to drag add-more elements around prompted me to try disabling the draggable functionality by adding <code>,&#039;sortable&#039; =&gt; false</code> to one of the add-more groups.</p>
<p>That fixed the problem. Now, the fields in that add-more are selectable/editable. But, the group is no longer draggable/sortable.</p>
<p>So, that leaves me with a different set of questions and challenges. </p>
<ol>
<li>Is this really a Piklist bug, or is it something in WordPress, or simply an issue with any iOS or touch-input device?</li>
<li>Is there anything that can be done to allow both the dragging of the add-more sections and editing on iOS?</li>
<li>Could the sortable flag be conditional based on the user&#8217;s device (PC vs mobile device)?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would rather not turn off the ability to sort the add-more groups entirely.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I ran across an issue where clicking on an Add More field fails to bring focus to the field and allow characters to be entered. It seems to only happens in Firefox, not in Chrome. WordPress 3.7.1 Piklist 0.8.0b6 My guess is that this is a bug with the sortable functionality? Can this be fixed? [&#8230;]</p>
