										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi!<br />
I&#8217;m building a webapp where two types of users need to sign up and have access to their specific account/dashboards. One user type will be registering and listing activities &amp; camps, the other will be registering and adding their children.</p>
<p>The registration form needs to be front end. The accounts/dashboard ideally front end but if there is a way to highly customize WP admin pages that could work too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m new to Piklist and have used Advanced Custom Fields and Formidable.<br />
But never used those two in this particular manner.</p>
