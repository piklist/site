<p>The issue is that the conditions field parameter wants a field to watch. I&#8217;ve tried &#8216;field&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;__related_post&#8217; but that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>For each song, the user should be able to add the title, artist, and a URL. This should be a repeater, so the user can add as many songs as needed. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying this, but it&#8217;s not working:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Music&#039;,
	&#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;Add songs from this episode&#039;,
	&#039;add_more&#039; =&gt; true,

	&#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
		array(
			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
			&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;song title&#039;,
			&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;song_title&#039;
		),
		array(
			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
			&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;song artist&#039;,
			&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;song_artist&#039;
		),
		array(
			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
			&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;song url&#039;,
			&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;song_url&#039;
		)
	)

));</code></pre>
<p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hullo there, I&#8217;m in situation where I would want to use an editor field but put a condition on it like the rest so that it displays only when another field value is equal to the one specified; just like the normal conditionals. However, I&#8217;ve noticed that when I add a condition parameter to the editor field, it stops working and won&#8217;t show up in the metabox. Is there a way to do this or it&#8217;s just not possible with Piklist? Thanks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just tested the demo text fields in the<em> demo settings</em> pages to see if there&#8217;s some sort of limit to how much can be entered into a single field and found that there&#8217;s none. Personally, I&#8217;d love to control how much a user can enter into any given field as a safe guard. I wouldn&#8217;t want a user to enter 200 characters into text field where I expect him/her to enter just about 15 characters. For example, I have text field for the Headline and I don&#8217;t want the user to enter more than 25 characters into this field, is there a way I can do this with Piklist? I don&#8217;t seem find it in the validation and field parameters tutorials in the documentation. Any help is highly appreciated.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I am pretty sure that I saw the ability to make a field &#8220;read-only&#8221; in your WordCamp NYC presentation but I cannot figure out how to implement it now. Is there a field parameter that can be set to make a field read only for a capability set or a role? Thank you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I have noticed that in the code examples for some of the fields the code is slightly different for displaying the field description: ,&#8217;description&#8217; =&#62; __(&#8216;Description Text&#8217;) or ,&#8217;description&#8217; =&#62; &#8216;Description Text&#8217; They both seem to work.  Is one way better than the other?
