										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br />
I&#8217;m relatively new to Piklist and a novice coder taking on an ambitious project. Learning as I go. Yay.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m stumbling on this:</p>
<p>I have a profile for a child and there is a birthday field on the submission form. The datepicker doesn&#8217;t seem to be the right tool for the job so I&#8217;m going to use fields for day, month and year.<br />
Each child will can be signed up to an activity which is age specific, meaning that there is a cut off age. The activity form will have fields for age limit (min and max). I am somehow going to connect the activity post type to the child and I need an alert or error message if the age isn&#8217;t appropriate to the age range set in the activity.</p>
<p>1. If there is a field type &#8220;date&#8221; in Piklist.<br />
2. How I should go about triggering the alert or error message. My idea it to conditionally show the alert by pulling the month &amp; year variable from the Activity profile and comparing to month &amp; year variable for the child and having an error message if outside the range. Is this something that&#8217;s doable? Or is there a whole bunch of PHP timestamp stuff I need to look into to make things more dynamic.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi. I have a datepicker field. When I create a new post, the default value is 01. January, 1970. I need for it to be empty, also when I save the post. I tried to add this to the field options: &#039;options&#039; =&#62; array( &#039;dateFormat&#039; =&#62; &#039;d-m-yy&#039;, &#039;setDate&#039; =&#62; null ) and value to empty. [&#8230;]</p>

I have a datepicker field. When I create a new post, the default value is 01. January, 1970. I need for it to be empty, also when I save the post. I tried to add this to the field options:</p>
<pre><code>&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(

	&#039;setDate&#039; =&gt; null
)</code></pre>
<p>and value to empty. Is there something else I could do to have an empty value in the datepicker field?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Is there a way to create validation for a datepicker that guarantees the date selected is a minimum of x number of days out? For instance, I&#8217;d like to use the datepicker to have clients provide a due date, but would also adhere to a minimum timeframe (say 14 days). Thanks,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to build a CPT for simple events. It should be a normal post with an additional event date-field. I want to show the next 5 events in a widget.</p>
<p>Everything works fine, I created the CPT with a DatePicker-Field, but the entered date is saved using my specified &#8216;dateFormat&#8217; (in my case &#8216;dd.mm.yy&#8217;). My problem is now, that I can&#8217;t order the events using WP_Query, because I would need a timestamp or anything like this, to oder the events by their date.</p>
<p>So my question is: Can I use the DatePicker-Field to save the entered Event as timestamp or something similar, that I can use for &#8220;order by&#8221;?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Sebastian</p>
