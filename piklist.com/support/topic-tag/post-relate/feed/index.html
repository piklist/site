										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,<br />
I have a requirement and don&#8217;t know how it can be achieved with piklist.</p>
<p>I created a few fields for products cpt (SKU, Description, Price etc).  In the order cpt,<br />
I managed to generate a dynamic choice field based on all the SKUs.  When the user select the relevant SKU, I would like the other fields in the order fields to be auto populated by the SKU.</p>
<p>Example,<br />
Product CPT<br />
SKU1, Shampoo, $3.00<br />
SKU2, Shampoo-go, $5.00</p>
<p>Order CPT,<br />
Select Field A, Field B, Field C<br />
[SKU1, SKU2],   &#8221; &#8220;, &#8221; &#8221;</p>
<p>When user select SKU1, I would like Field B and Field C to be auto-populated with Shampoo, and $3.00 automatically.</p>
<p>Can this be done with piklist?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just discovered Piklist and it is really great and basically the thing I was searching for &#8211; giving me the features of plugins like ACF but still the flexibility of PHP code.<br />
Let&#8217;s hope Piklist will be further developed and maintained for a long, long time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I want a repeating/loop/&#8221;add more&#8221; field with items that each have a post-relate field.</p>
<p>I tried the following code (how sleek and beautiful Piklist code is!)</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Test
Post Type: parent-post
*/

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
  &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;group&#039;
  ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;items&#039;
  ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Items&#039;
  ,&#039;add_more&#039; =&gt; true
  ,&#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
    array(
      &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;
      ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;field-1&#039;
      ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Field 1&#039;
      ,&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;&#039;
    )
    ,array(
      &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;post-relate&#039;
      ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
      ,&#039;template&#039; =&gt; &#039;field&#039;
    )
  )
));
</code></pre>
<p>While the normal text field is in each &#8220;add more&#8221; item, the post-relate field is shown only once below all the &#8220;add more&#8221; items.<br />
What could be wrong with the code above &#8211; how can I have a post-relate field per &#8220;add more&#8221; item?</p>
<p>I also attached a screenshot.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and<br />
with best regards</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I need to create the following data structure in wp: { &#34;type&#34;: &#34;log&#34;, &#34;id&#34;: 21, &#34;log_day_1&#34;: { // what does this object represent in piklist? a CPT or field? &#34;log_day_activity&#34;: [ // this is just the array of associated posts objects via piklist { &#34;id&#34;: &#34;25213&#34;, &#34;desc&#34;: &#34;I did this on this day and time&#34; [&#8230;]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I need to create the following data structure in wp:</p>
<pre><code>{
	&quot;type&quot;: &quot;log&quot;,
	&quot;id&quot;: 21,
        &quot;log_day_1&quot;: { // what does this object represent in piklist? a CPT or field?

	         &quot;log_day_activity&quot;: [ // this is just the array of associated posts objects via piklist 
			{
			    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;25213&quot;,
                            &quot;desc&quot;: &quot;I did this on this day and time&quot;
                        },
                      ]
}</code></pre>
<p>as you can see from the comments in the object, I&#8217;m struggling a bit. Should I use a custom repeatable field for days or create it&#8217;s own post type.</p>
<p>Can piklist associate posts to a custom field and do it more than one on a post? If so, how? And are there any guides in terms of querying the post and it&#8217;s activities for any particular day?</p>
<p>Or do I need to create a post called &#8220;Log&#8221; Then a post called &#8220;days&#8221; and associate &#8220;log&#8221; with &#8220;days&#8221; and then &#8220;days with it&#8217;s respective activities? </p>
<p>The second option seems laborious but will do it if it&#8217;s the only way. Let me know what you recommend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am preparing a new website and wanted to make extensive use of *piklist*. I searched for a solution to add an autocomplete field in this support forum and on Google. I need it as an opportunity to exchange the type of <code>post-relate</code>, as it only adds dozens of checkboxes which is not helpful the more posts are produced.</p>
<p>I found a support post whose writer probably had a similar interest but it was closed already and no solution provided (cf. https://piklist.com/support/topic/custom-field-tutorial-or-template-repo/).</p>
<p>As I inspected the source code I found some tidbits, like this <code>&lt;!-- TODO: Ajax Search --&gt;</code>. Hence I guess you already have plans on integrating kind of an autocompletion to this feature. Do you already have a beta version or preliminary source code, which I could stick to?</p>
<p>As I understood the <code>piklist_field_templates</code> filter for the functions.php is not for that, because you can only change the outward appearance but not the innards which would be necessary to make use of jQueryUI for example.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Alexander</p>

<p>There is still a wp_post_relationships table with 224 entries. It won&#8217;t be difficult to write a script to convert these to postmeta entries. So that&#8217;s my plan unless you have a better suggestion. </p>
<p>Hope NYC is treating you well! </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the scenario. I&#8217;m building a simple system to manage church families. I have two CPT: contacts and households.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using a check box on the contact CPT to indicate whether a new household CPT should be created for the contact. This is used if the household isn&#8217;t already in existence. I&#8217;ve hooked into <code>piklist_save_field</code> to look for the checkbox and create the household.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m not sure how to relate the contact to the newly created household. Can you point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>Stories has two fields that point to people: Author and People Involved.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that when I do a get_posts for people involved in the story, I get all the people related (author and people involved). The question is, how would I discern between whether a person was related via the author field or the people involved field?</p>
