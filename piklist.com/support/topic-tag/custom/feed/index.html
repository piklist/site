					<description><![CDATA[<p>I searched but didn&#8217;t see anything on this. I have a frontend form that is created by piklist. I can view the form after using the shortcode. Is there anyway to add a custom class and attribute to the form fields? I&#8217;d rather not go in and use jquery if I can avoid it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi! just wondering how to process the setting-page on a &#8216;submit/save&#8217;? So, what i want is that the setting page shows some settings, (eg &#8220;run now?&#8221; checkbox) and after saving them, i want to process &#8216;specific code&#8217; based on this field if &#8216;selected&#8217;. How to hook into this saving-process? thanks</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I love the plugin!  I was wondering would it be possible to create a custom piklist form on the admin side, but do the form processing myself.  Basically, I want to create a settings page using the piklist fields, but I want to be able to process the post data myself.  I don&#8217;t want the data to go into the wp_options table,  my plugin has some custom tables that I need to insert the data into.   </p>
<p>This may not be possible, but I figured I would give piklist a shot first. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Sean</p>
