										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone else had the same question. I wanted to use the color picker with some predefined color options. I couldn&#8217;t find anything on this site or anywhere else (but may not have searched properly). I did find a post about how to set the default palette for all color pickers (<a href="https://siteorigin.com/thread/custom-iris-picker/" target="_blank">https://siteorigin.com/thread/custom-iris-picker/</a>); but, that solution didn&#8217;t quite work. Initial colorpicker fields still showed the default options. Only when used as or in an add-more did my custom palettes show. So, not a good option; unless I have stumbled on a fixable bug. </p>
<p>A little more experimentation and this is what I figured out:</p>
<pre><code>array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;colorpicker&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;color-bk&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Highlight Color&#039;
    ,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
        &#039;palettes&#039; =&gt; array(&#039;#00bbff&#039;, &#039;#ffbb00&#039;,&#039;#aaaaaa&#039;, &#039;#dd9933&#039;,&#039;#eeee22&#039;, &#039;#81d742&#039;, &#039;#ff0000&#039;)
    )
)</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to set the default colors that are displayed as options on the bottom of the color picker. I do not claim it is the most efficient or elegant solution, if you want the same default palette across multiple colorpicker fields. But it does appear to work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to place an Add More group (3 text fields) into a settings page, but I cannot get the information to save.  I am currently using 0.8 b6, but I experienced the same behavior in b5.  I can replicate this behavior in the Piklist Demo settings page.  If I try to add information to the Add More group it does not stick. I have tried this on three separate installs with the same results.<br />
Single add more fields seem to save just fine. </p>
<p>I checked the wp_options table and the data is not being saved to the option.  Although I can see it in the transients.  </p>
