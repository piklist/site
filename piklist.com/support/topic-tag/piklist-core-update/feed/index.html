										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was trying piklist, and created plugins with piklist dependence,</p>
<p>now today got piklist update nag message and i did update with wp<br />
and after downloading wp somehow not able to activate after unzip the file,<br />
and then suddenly all site break, as other active plugins which are dependent of piklist not working. </p>
<p>&#8211; as i am developer and i manually delete all my plugins and then browse admin<br />
and activate piklist and then resume my plugin. </p>
<p>&#8211; here is case if i distribute piklist dependent plugins , then such kind of case<br />
will break the client main site and lots of others issue and confidence on piklist<br />
will shattered also on our plugins, </p>
<p>So piklist update process have to be safe , and ready to be this kind of exception issue, as lots of others plugins will dependent on that.</p>
<p>take this seriously and do take appropriate measure. </p>
