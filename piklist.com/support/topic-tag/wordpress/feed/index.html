										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am using the latest version of Wp and running the genesis framework. The customizer in multiple child themes offered by Studiopress is not working. I also have a plugin with a few widgets I created and a few settings pages. When I delete the widgets the customizer comes back. The setting are not affecting anything. I have attached a screenshot of the errors I am getting in the console when the widgets are active on the customizer page. It does this when any widget is added to the widgets folder.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>is it possible to store the data from the meta boxes in custom tables? I understand I can use <code>scope</code> to save data to different wordpress inherent tables, but for example wordpress saves <code>postmeta</code> as <code>longtext</code> even if I were to store just numbers or dates. I would appreciate any hint on how I can store data to a different table, or maybe the same table I just would add some columns to, with different data types. This would improve the time for searching and aggregating objects.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a support request, but I just wanted to let you know how easy Piklist has made developing my first plugin. I am used to working with PHP frameworks, and wordpress seemed so loose for me. Piklist closed that gap and brought me to production real fast! I wonder why this wasn&#8217;t developed by the WP team in the first place!</p>
<p>My plugin is a one-click LinkedIn login solution for wordpress that allows users to login to WP via their linkedin credentials. You can take a look here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/linkedin-login/</p>
<p>By the way, is there any directory of Piklist-based plugins, or anyway to determine which plugins have been built on top of Piklist? </p>

$query = new WP_Query($args);

$states = array();
