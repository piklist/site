										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I needed a hierarchical taxonomy select list, so I built my own, (thanks to the incredible flexibility of piklist)<br />
However, I am in dire need of some help.</p>
<p>You can see the field working here:<br />
<img src="http://dec.imghost.us/tJNX.png" alt="Heirarchical Taxonomy Select List" /></p>
<p>The problem I&#8217;m having and I&#8217;m hoping Kevin can help, is when I save my selections.</p>
<p>It saves exactly how I want, as an Array.<br />
Just like the checkbox field does.</p>
<p>The problem I&#8217;m having is that unlike the checkbox field, if I select more than one field, it creates TWO select boxes, and duplicates it. Here&#8217;s my example:<br />
<img src="http://dec.imghost.us/tJQN.png" alt="Error within Box" /></p>
<p>Having walked through the piklist code many times, I&#8217;m assuming its doing this, because it is not passing an ARRAY of values to the new field I created. Checkbox is sent an array of values, and only called once per checkbox group.<br />
Mine is called on every value, even though it is pulling from an array of values, so the $value field in my new box, is always just a single value, never an array. </p>
<p>Could you guys please help. What code would you need me to post, to give you a better idea of where I&#8217;m going wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks </p>
