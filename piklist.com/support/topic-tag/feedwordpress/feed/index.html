										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not sure if this is a Piklist issue but I figured I would explain it and see if I have any help or suggestions as I am really stuck.</p>
<p>I used FeedWordpress to pull an RSS feed item in and place it in a metabox inside the post. I am using a theme called &#8220;Musik&#8221; that uses Piklist and East Digital Downloads to allow music files to be bought and played in a mp3 player.</p>
<p>Right now FeedWordpress sends the mp3 url to the correct field called &#8220;preview mp3&#8221; and then it publishes the post. When I go to the post it doesn&#8217;t find any mp3 url. If I hit update on the post it fixes it and the mp3 can be previewed. </p>
<p>It seems that the field is not saving when it is published and only when it is updated.</p>
<p>I am wondering if this is an issue with how the theme dev wrote the piklist field in or not. Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
