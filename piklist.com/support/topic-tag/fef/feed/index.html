										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have successfully created a page w/an FEF to create new posts of a cpt.<br />
I have a similar page w/a copy of the FEF to edit the same cpts, but:<br />
&#8211; how do I direct a user to that page w/the id of the cpt to edit in the form?<br />
&#8211; what would the url look like?<br />
&#8211; what do I put in the FEF forms to make it save? scope = &#8216;post&#8217;? scope = &#8216;my_cpt&#8217; ?<br />
&#8211; which is the right hook to check the validation result and redirect accordingly?<br />
&#8211; which is the right hook /after/ it&#8217;s validated and saved to redirect accordingly (may be data dependent&#8211;the single &#8216;Redirect:&#8217; comment in the header isn&#8217;t enough)</p>
