										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to have the shortcode from RoyalSlider plugin appear in the Piklist shortcodes.</p>
<p>At first I just tried adding it via the &#8220;Allow Shortcode UI&#8221; in Piklist&#8217;s &#8220;Settings&#8221;. But it doesn&#8217;t work? It is not appearing in the shortcodes windows next to Piklist Form as expected. Is there something I am missing?</p>
<p>I then startet creating a Piklist shortcode manually that would just print out the RoyalSlider. It requires an &#8220;id&#8221; attribute, but I noticed that &#8220;id&#8221; is not accepted as field in my piklist shortcode (or it is ignored). But if i set it to &#8221; id&#8221; (with a space) it will appear in the shortcode (and even appears to work).</p>
<p>I have tested it with only Piklist adn RoyalSlider on a fresh WordPress installation on Linux server.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Guys, </p>
<p>Huge fan of Piklist and really excited about all of the recent improvements, especially add-more related. I&#8217;m trying to add an editor field to a page template and want to be able to use shortcodes in the editor field. I currently have the following code for the editor field:</p>
<pre><code> piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;editor&#039;,
    &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;tc_education_editor&#039;, // This is the field name of the WordPress default editor
    &#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Program Boxes&#039;,
    &#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;page&#039;,
    &#039;template&#039; =&gt; &#039;field&#039;, // Only display the field not the label
    &#039;options&#039; =&gt; array( // Pass any option that is accepted by wp_editor()

        &#039;wp_autoresize_on&#039; =&gt; true
      )
    )
  ));</code></pre>
<p>When I try to add a Piklist shortcode (using the shortcode button) the shortcode winds up saving to the standard page editor field and not the Piklist field. Any help you can give on this is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
<p>Also I originally had it set-up with the scope to Post and then changed to page to see if that would work. I&#8217;m pretty sure that it should always be post (unless its a CPT) but figured I&#8217;d try to cover all the bases.</p>
