					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I&#8217;m trying to make the plugin work on a multisite with child themes where every site in the network has it&#8217;s own child theme. Piklist is enabled globally throughout the network. Where do I put the piklist folder with my custom fields files? I tried every variation but it still doesn&#8217;t work. Thank you.</p>
