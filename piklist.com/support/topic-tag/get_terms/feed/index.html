										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>So I got the basics down now where I can display a list of post_metas along the side of the post editor. This is a replica of what the tags and categories looks like.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to do now is to be able to make that more dynamic rather then static php.</p>
<p>This is what I would like to do and hopefully you can guide me to the right path. I created a custom post type &#8220;Providers&#8221; and I would like to have a taxonomy of &#8220;Specialty&#8221; where we can add more specialties as they come in via the admin menu Providers &gt; Specialties. I got the taxonomy menu to show up using this code:</p>
<p>http://pastebin.com/aBitgirP</p>
<p>I also have the specialty values pulling into the post editor using this code:</p>
<p>http://pastebin.com/3fQ1Wn17</p>
<p>Now I understand that I would need to plug in the values in the taxonomy page but how would I pull in those taxonomies using piklist?</p>
<p>Thanks for the support!</p>
