										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have just installed your WordPress helpers product withe the objective of enabling the fetured images in the rss feed from a site. I can see that references to the image(s) are being generated in the feed but when I inspect the data the urls are relative to the host site and therefore not usable by a 3rd party rss reader. </p>
<p>I am using WordPress 4.8 and am wondering if this may be due to a change in recent releases of WordPress?  </p>
