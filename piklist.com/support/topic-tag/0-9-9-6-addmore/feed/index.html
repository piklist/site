										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy &#8211; with the upgrade to 0.9.9.6, the change in the way add more fields are stored has caused the code in several of our themes accessing that data to be broken. Is there any sort of polyfill available (maybe a get_option hook) that can convert the data structure back to its legacy format? Ideally it would be something that could be enabled on a per-theme or per-plugin basis. That would really help bridge the gap while we go through the process of upgrading. If nothing like that exists, could you give a pointer in the right direction on how to get the list of add more fields? With that, I don&#8217;t mind taking a crack at building something.</p>
