										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know that you want to have Piklist as a regular plugin, but in my case it&#8217;s better to have it sort of hidden from the users.<br />
You see, in my language, &#8216;Pik&#8217; means &#8216;Penis&#8217; which means that &#8216;Piklist&#8217; roughly translates to &#8216;List of penises&#8217;&#8230; As such, I don&#8217;t wont the name to appear anywhere in the admin interface. Since there&#8217;s really no settings to be dealt with, it would be optimal to include it directly in the theme. Furthermore, my clients wont be installing plugins such as Piklist themselves, so there&#8217;s no chance of conflicting versions.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like is an explanation of how to implement the framework directly into my theme, or at least how to remove the admin menu item. Otherwise the name is kind of a dealbreaker for my company&#8230;</p>
