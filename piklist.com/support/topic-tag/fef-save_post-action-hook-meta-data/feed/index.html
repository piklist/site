When using a piklist form (FEF), it would seem that the save_post action hook is now called only after the post has been saved, but /before/ the piklist meta fields have been saved.<br />
This is kind of breaking with the piklist philosophy of &#8220;do it the wordpress way&#8221;.<br />
Furthermore, I cannot seem to find in the documentation or here in the forum a list of piklist action hooks to know which hook to use to replace &#8216;save_post&#8217; (or &#8216;save_post_{cpt}&#8217;) after /piklist forms/ have saved all the post meta field data.</p>
<p>How is this achieved?</p>
