										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,<br />
To workaround an issue I am redirecting the user back to the normal view of a CPT after they submit changes to it via FEF.</p>
<p>I have achieved this using the <strong>piklist_request_field</strong> filter, but wonder what other ways the community might suggest this could be done more efficiently.<br />
It also relies on the <em>Redirect:</em> comment block directive &#8211; if this is removed, my code doesn&#8217;t get called.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my code:</p>
<pre><code>//
//	Alter the Redirect link for Edit Listing form
//
add_filter( &#039;piklist_request_field&#039;, &#039;thearr_request_field&#039; );
function thearr_request_field( $field )
{
        // only interested in the redirect field
	if ( strcmp(&#039;redirect&#039;, $field[&#039;field&#039;]) === 0 )
	{
                // this is what tells the FEF which data to use
		if ( isset( $_REQUEST[&#039;_post&#039;][&#039;ID&#039;] ) )
		{
			// change redirection back to the normal view after edit
			$field[&#039;value&#039;] = get_permalink( $_REQUEST[&#039;_post&#039;][&#039;ID&#039;] );
		}
	}

	return $field;
}</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,<br />
I&#8217;ve got a FEF to edit a CPT, where all works fine when I make a change the first time.<br />
After submit I get the form page back with a notice to say it has saved, and sure enough the data has changed.<br />
If I then make another change and submit, it looks like it works from the front end, however the changes are not saved into the database.<br />
It is not until I reload the page (not refresh) that I can make changes and have them save.</p>
<p>The difference I can see in comparing the source of the page in &#8216;fresh&#8217; state and &#8216;after submit&#8217; state is the attributes data-piklist-field-group=&#8221;xxxxxx&#8221; &#8211; which changes every time it is rendered anyway.</p>
<p>My current workaround is to dynamically redirect the user back to the normal view of the CPT (just about to post a question on this), but would prefer the option of staying on the page unless user indicates so (e.g. Save | Save and go back)</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a page that generates reports. It has a form asking for start date and number of weeks. When input is received, it prints the report and below the report shows the form again with the h2 heading &#8220;Generate Another Report.&#8221; See example at https://pik.redpup.net/reports/. </p>
<p>Because the reports can be very long, when I display a report I put a button at the top that says &#8220;generate another report&#8221; and links to &#8220;#generate&#8221; which is the ID for the h2 at the bottom of the page. Saves people from scrolling all the way. </p>
<p>But when the form is posted, it retains &#8220;#generate&#8221; as part of its action URL and so if the user posts another form, they are scrolled past the new report back to the generate form. This is the case whether method is post or get. </p>
<p>The piklist/parts/fields/form.php file starts with: </p>
<pre><code>&lt;form 
  method=&quot;&lt;?php echo strtolower($data[&#039;method&#039;]); ?&gt;&quot; 
  action=&quot;&lt;?php echo $data[&#039;filter&#039;] ? home_url() . $data[&#039;action&#039;] : null; ?&gt;&quot; </code></pre>
<p>So I tried adding an &#8220;Action&#8221; parameter to the parts/forms file: </p>
<pre><code>/*  
Title: Choose Report
Method: post
Action: /reports/
Message: 
*/
</code></pre>
<p>But it has no effect. Is there a way to override the default action?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi!<br />
I&#8217;m building a webapp where two types of users need to sign up and have access to their specific account/dashboards. One user type will be registering and listing activities &amp; camps, the other will be registering and adding their children.</p>
<p>The registration form needs to be front end. The accounts/dashboard ideally front end but if there is a way to highly customize WP admin pages that could work too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m new to Piklist and have used Advanced Custom Fields and Formidable.<br />
But never used those two in this particular manner.</p>

<p>I want to save info from the Front End Form (FEF) on the current post. I stumbled on a comment somewhere that said there is no direct functionality because multiple posts can be updated in one FEF submisison, so I am looking for a way to overload that. Currently, my code only creates a new post of the same below post type.</p>
<p>The following topics seemed most relevant:<br />

<p>$id successfully fills. I am using version 0.9.9.9. I tried using code from @mcmaster, but I&#8217;m not too sure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a front-end form (tickets purchase) that was working fine with beta 0.9.5v but I ran into several problems with 0.9.9. I have been able to resolve all but this. I have been using a redirect field in the comment block at the top of the file. Initially this was set to &#8220;review_url&#8221; as I couldn&#8217;t put a function in the Redirect field: </p>
<p>In <code>piklist/parts/ticket-order-form.php</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/*  
Title: Ticket Order Form
Method: post
Message: Data saved as a post of type ticket.
Redirect: review_url
*/</code></pre>
<p>In <code>functions.php</code>:</p>
<pre><code>add_filter( &#039;piklist_add_part&#039;, &#039;mcw_form_redirect&#039;, 10, 2 );
function mcw_form_redirect ( $data, $type ) {
	// if not a form then bail
	if ( $type != &#039;form&#039; ) {
		return $data;
	}
	// check if any page template is set in the comment block
	if ( ( $data[&#039;redirect&#039;] ) == &#039;review_url&#039; ) {
		$data[&#039;redirect&#039;] = home_url( &#039;/tickets/order-review/&#039; );
	}
	return $data;
}</code></pre>
<p>After upgrading to 0.9.9.6, it tried to send me to <code>http://mysite.com/review_url</code> which of course was 404. I changed the Redirect field: </p>
<pre><code>/*  
Title: Ticket Order Form
Method: post
Message: Data saved as a post of type ticket.
Redirect: /tickets/order-review/
*/</code></pre>
<p>Now it sends me to the correct page, but doesn&#8217;t pass the $_REQUEST parameters so I can&#8217;t process the form inputs. </p>
<p>Is Redirect no longer supported? Is there another way to do this? </p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Donna</p>
