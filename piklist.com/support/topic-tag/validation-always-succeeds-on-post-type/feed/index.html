										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br />
I have registered a Piklist post type and created a custom validation rule in my functions.php file for my theme. I have created the validation rule to do a test validation fail. However, both its field and the one which should have failed both the &#8220;email&#8221; and &#8220;url&#8221; tests (the conditions were not set at the same time) are all causing a post publish or update. Am I modifying the wrong file? If so, which file(s) should I be modifying? Use (theme-root) and (piklist-root) as wild cards for the root folders of my theme and the Piklist plugin, respectively, and give me full paths from there. Thank you!</p>
