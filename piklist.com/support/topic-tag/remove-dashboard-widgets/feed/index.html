										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings,<br />
First of all thank you for wordpress-helpers &amp; piklist. Coming from a traditional data modelling background, I think these two actually gives WP developer super-powers as far as modelling is concerned. Yes I have added them as first two plugins in our WP-Cli based new WP installation script :-).<br />
I am seeing a strange behaviour with wp-helpers=&gt; Remove Dashboard Widget, it shows user roles instead of widgets (screenshot attached).<br />
This may not be a bug as I installed on fresh installation and it worked. However unable to get it to show dashboard widgets in actual project installation. Tried delete and reinstall but still see the same. Can you please provide some pointers as what might have gone wrong ?<br />
Thanks<br />
Bhushan </p>
