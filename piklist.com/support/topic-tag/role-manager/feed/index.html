										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PikList is fantastic as it opens up so many possibilities for leveraging WordPress as a application framework.  One of the set backs though is that you have to work with WordPress&#8217;s structure.</p>
<p>PikList allows you to create a customer back end but WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a good way of filtering the default post list pages to show only those posts that were written by the current logged in user.  At least not that I know of.</p>
<p>Even with a good roles and capabilities plugin this is difficult to do as it seems that you can limit a users ability to edit other&#8217;s posts but not hide those posts completely.</p>
<p>Do you have a solid way of setting a custom post type to only show the posts that were created by the current user in that custom post types post list page? ( ../edit.php?post_type=MY_CPT )</p>
<p>This seems like one of the crucial pieces to making PikList a super solid application framework for WordPress</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
