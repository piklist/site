										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found Piklist when I wanted to display a taxonomy as a checkbox group.  I had already created the taxonomy the traditional way in the functions file. To get the checkbox group, I added the Piklist meta-box code. Except for having the tradition tags meta box and the Piklist checkbox group, all was good. Adding meta_box_cb =&gt; false took care of that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing another site and want to use Piklist to create some taxonomies without having to create them in the functions file.  My problem is, I don&#8217;t know how to populate the terms. The meta-box says &#8220;Terms will appear when they are added to this taxonomy.&#8221; but where/how do I add them? I tried adding &#8216;supports =&gt; tags&#8217; but that didn&#8217;t add a meta-box. Ideally, I&#8217;d like to specify the terms for the taxonomy so no one can add any terms. Great plugin! TIA for the help.. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! How do you show only terms with a specific term meta?</p>
<p>Lets say I have two taxonomy namely specialty and area.</p>
<p>The area taxonomy will have a meta using the specialty id.</p>
<p>I would only want to show area terms that has a specific area terms.</p>
<p>I know i can easily do this by using hierarchical taxonomy but it would be hard if the list has a lot of parent terms.</p>
