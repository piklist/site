										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>hi Everybody,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very new to piklist. Trying to achieve a simple functionality. Need to have a custom post type with some fields: Text, checkbox, etc. Sounds simple but cant find the way to associate field types with custom post types. I looked through user guide, could define custom posts and fields, but could not make fields appear in the custom post. I&#8217;m missing something, but cant find what exactly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d  appreciate if you could share a simple example with me.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
Ruben</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,<br />
How can I do listed custom posts with select field ? When I select one of custom post, then it&#8217;s taxonomy will be shown with another select field (It will be conditional filtering taxonomy according to Custom Post). Is it possible with Piklist ?<br />
I have got already the custom post array with below code:</p>
<pre><code>$args = array( &#039;public&#039; =&gt; true , &#039;_builtin&#039; =&gt; false);
$post_types = get_post_types($args, &#039;objects&#039;);</code></pre>
<p>Thanks</p>
