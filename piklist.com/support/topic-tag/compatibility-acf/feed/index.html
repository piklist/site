										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys &#8211; We use Piklist fairly extensively for some of our core plugins, but some of the themes that our agency partners deliver utilize ACF, and there are a couple unique things it does well &#8211; particularly the flexible content plugin. In any case, even on pages where I do not have any Piklist metaboxes, when Piklist is active it breaks the drag &#8216;n drop functionality of ACF&#8217;s flexible content field.</p>
<p>Basically, every time you start dragging, dozens of drop zones get created. Disable Piklist and everything goes back to normal. I have not done in-depth debugging, but I would expect that the jQuery UI sortable selector that Piklist uses for some of its fields (like repeater) is too broad and also getting attached to the ACF fields. Would really like to get these two playing nicely together!</p>
