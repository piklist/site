										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am preparing a new website and wanted to make extensive use of *piklist*. I searched for a solution to add an autocomplete field in this support forum and on Google. I need it as an opportunity to exchange the type of <code>post-relate</code>, as it only adds dozens of checkboxes which is not helpful the more posts are produced.</p>
<p>I found a support post whose writer probably had a similar interest but it was closed already and no solution provided (cf. https://piklist.com/support/topic/custom-field-tutorial-or-template-repo/).</p>
<p>As I inspected the source code I found some tidbits, like this <code>&lt;!-- TODO: Ajax Search --&gt;</code>. Hence I guess you already have plans on integrating kind of an autocompletion to this feature. Do you already have a beta version or preliminary source code, which I could stick to?</p>
<p>As I understood the <code>piklist_field_templates</code> filter for the functions.php is not for that, because you can only change the outward appearance but not the innards which would be necessary to make use of jQueryUI for example.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Alexander</p>
