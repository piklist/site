										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working on an app that uses front end forms to update a CPT and have moved it up to wpengine for hosting and they&#8217;re saying there&#8217;s a conflict with the query string and whatever nginx redirection setup they have configured. (it works on their staging server config, but not on their production server config)</p>
<p>They&#8217;re suggesting that I use <code>?_somethingelse[id]=123</code> and it will work. Is there a non-hacky way to accomplish this in piklist, or some other approach I can take? Or do I have to host this somewhere else?</p>
