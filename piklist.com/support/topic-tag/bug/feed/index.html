										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a number field which has a range of 0-999999999<br />
and &#8216;required&#8217; =&gt; true<br />
like so:</p>
<p>            &#8216;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;number&#8217;,<br />
            &#8216;field&#8217; =&gt; zzz,<br />

            )</p>
<p>you would think that 0 will pass the required if statement!<br />
but it won&#8217;t:<br />
in &#8220;class-piklist-validate.php&#8221; line 656 it says<br />
&#8220;if (empty($required))&#8221;<br />
0 is also empty so you will get this validation error no matter what<br />
i changed it to &#8220;if (empty($required) &amp;&amp; !is_numeric($required) )&#8221;<br />
and it does what i want it</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been trying to figure out why my Pages section was not being loaded correctly on my site and have narrowed it down to Piklist &amp; Divi combination. Disabling either one fixes the issue. I am running latest versions of everything: WordPress v5.0.1, Piklist v1.0.1 &amp; Divi v3.18.5.</p>
<p>Here is what&#8217;s thrown in the error log:</p>
<pre><code>[13-Dec-2018 03:38:18 UTC] PHP Warning:  array_search() expects parameter 2 to be array, string given in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/dev/weltrade/wp-content/themes/Divi/includes/builder/feature/BlockEditorIntegration.php on line 299

<p>what&#8217;s happening on the Pages section is only some of the lists of pages loads (8 in my case), and the rest of the page gets cutoff (WordPress crashes and does&#8217;t even add all closing footer tags, so the table is all messed up).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WP 4.9.5<br />
Piklist 0.9.9.15</p>
<p>I had a file upload field associated with a custom post type that was working correctly in 0.9.9.12:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;,
	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;_job_download&#039;,

	&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
		&#039;basic&#039; =&gt; true
	)
));</code></pre>
<p><strong>What I tried:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add new post</li>
<li>Click file upload &#8220;Browse&#8230;&#8221; button, choose a file</li>
<li>Save a draft of the post</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What I expected:</strong></p>
<p>I expected to see something representing the file I attached below the &#8220;Browse&#8230;&#8221; button, with the file name and a button to remove it.</p>
<p><strong>What I got:</strong></p>
<p>No indication that the file attachment was successful. With WP_DEBUG on, I get the following warnings after saving a draft, and they appear on a blank white page (no WP admin UI loads in this case):</p>
<blockquote><p>Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist.php on line 1533</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been noticing this strange behavior when using a repeater field with a hidden field. In a nutshell, I created a settings page which is designed for a user to add in store locations (as many as they need). I have a location_id hidden field, which before saving to the database, I will programmatically fill in with a unique ID. When defining the field group, I specify a default value of &#8216;null&#8217; for the location_id field. Then, when the piklist_pre_update_option filter is fired, I will iterate through each location, check if the location_id field is null, and if it is, do what needs to be done to calculate the location ID. </p>
<p>The first field, this works great and as expected. However, once a second field is created, the default &#8216;null&#8217; value does not occur&#8230; in fact, the default value appears to somehow get cloned from whatever the first location&#8217;s entry is, which should not be the case.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, I created a little demo bug plugin which you can try attached. To simulate the &#8220;generate location id&#8221; process, I replaced this with a wp_rand call, which is unlikely to product the same number back to back. </p>
<p>To replicate this issue, do the following:</p>
<p>1. Install Piklist and the &#8220;Hidden Field Bug&#8221; plugin (attached)<br />
2. Navigate to the newly created &#8220;locations&#8221; settings page<br />
3. Make up a location name – such as &#8220;Location 1&#8221; and press &#8220;Save Location Information&#8221;<br />
4. Log into the WP Database (through phpMyAdmin or however you prefer).<br />
5. Run SQL Query [code]SELECT * FROM <code>wp_options</code> WHERE <code>option_name</code>=&#8217;demo_store_locations'[/code] (make sure you set your specific wp_ prefix for tables)<br />
6. Note the unique location_id generated in this serialized array. If you have trouble viewing the serialized data, use a site like https://www.functions-online.com/unserialize.html to unserialized this data.<br />
7. Go back to the Locations page in the WP-Admin, add a new location such as Location 2.<br />
8. Repeat the SQL query, and note that the location_id is the same for both locations. If you want to rule out the &#8216;possibility&#8217; that there was a number collision from the wp_rand() function used to generate location_id in this demo, keep adding in new locations and notice that the value is the same.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions, and looking forward to hearing back from you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m unable to update fields. They save fine the first time, but after that Update does nothing. I have deactivated all other plugins and unregistered the default custom-fields as advised in similar posts, but nothing helps. Also I&#8217;m running WordPress in German, and Piklist seems to translate back the &#8216;Update&#8217;, &#8216;Move to Trash&#8217;, &#8216;Preview Changes&#8217; [&#8230;]</p>
