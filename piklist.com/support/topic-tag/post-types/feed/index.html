										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just found a really weird issue. I&#8217;m making a client for a Spanish speaking client, and I noticed that I could no longer publish custom post types: when I clicked &#8220;Publish&#8221;, it saved as draft, and the &#8220;Save&#8221; button was gone. I spent a few hours testing, and I realized that the issue appears when I switch the site to Argentinian Spanish (es_AR). I tested other languages (Catalan, Japanese and Mexican Spanish) and there is no problem with them, just with Argentinian Spanish.</p>
<p>Here is a screencap of how the edit screen looks: http://jmp.sh/NNSFfgY</p>
<p>I also tested with a custom post type that I coded the regular WordPress way. If Piklist is enabled, the issue is also present when trying to publish this post type, but as soon as I disable Piklist, everything is fine. So the problem seems to be Piklist + Argentianian Spanish.</p>
<p>I realize that this is a really strange issue, but I would really appreciate help debugging and figuring out what is wrong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure this is 100% Piklist specific, but I am having some difficulty getting a CTP I created with Piklist to show on the front-end of WP.</p>
<p>I have created a CPT with a slug of &#8216;test&#8217; and I have created a file called &#8216;test-single.php&#8217; &#8211; In that file I have a basic WP loop (I&#8217;m not sure if this is the heart of the issue), however, I keep getting a 404 &#8211; is there something else I need to do?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />
Ian</p>
