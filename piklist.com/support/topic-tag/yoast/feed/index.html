<p>I had Piklist 0.9.9.12 and Yoast SEO 4.6 installed at the time of the log. I&#8217;ve just upgraded Yoast SEO to 4.7, but since I&#8217;m not sure what triggered that error output, I have no way to test if that will affect this issue.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Posted this question to Twitter yesterday and got a slight response, but will all my fields get read by Yoast if run them through the wpseo_pre_analysis_post_content filter? Can I have someone show an actual example of all fields being put through that filter? Thanks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve run into this a couple times now, and would love to see if there&#8217;s a simple solution. Basically, if the install is using WordPress SEO, it adds the &#8220;WordPress SEO by Yoast&#8221; meta-box. This box has a way of fighting for the top, since it&#8217;s apparently in High Priority. If I apply the Order field to any of the meta-boxes on the page, the SEO box immediately goes to the top. I&#8217;ve tried using High and Core Priority.</p>
<p>So this ends up meaning that if I want the meta-boxes above the SEO meta-box, I can&#8217;t order them manually. Otherwise they&#8217;ll all be below it.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how to get around this? Possibly change the SEO meta-box to the Advanced Context?</p>
