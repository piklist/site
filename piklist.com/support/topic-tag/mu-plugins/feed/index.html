<p>Other piklist plugins I&#8217;ve created do work in mu-plugins. I want to keep them out of the plugins area altogether so I hope this isn&#8217;t intentional?</p>
<p>Thanks for all the hard work. Really doing some cool things with piklist and the wp api.   </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Since so much of my multitenant/ multinetwork app depends on piklist, I thought moving it to mu-plugins makes sense. Especially since I don&#8217;t want to have to deal with enabling it per network and then with people enabling or disabling it site-by-site. There&#8217;s a few other reasons as well.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since so much of my multitenant/ multinetwork app depends on piklist, I thought moving it to mu-plugins makes sense. Especially since I don&#8217;t want to have to deal with enabling it per network and then with people enabling or disabling it site-by-site. There&#8217;s a few other reasons as well.</p>
<p>However, I noticed that when it&#8217;s in the MU-plugins folder, I get a bunch of 404s on admin side in the console. Mostly about js, css, icons and images. The code still works but I can&#8217;t interact with any of the custom fields. </p>
<p>Are you aware of this and is there any plan to fix it? Mu makes a lot of sense for piklist- for us, anyway. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, Do you think it&#8217;s a good idea to put piklist in the mu-plugin folder ? Indeed, I don&#8217;t want my customer see Pklist in the plugin list and I don&#8217;t want he could deactive it. I tried but there are some notice like : Undefined index: tab in /media/www/theme/wp-content/mu-plugins/piklist/parts/shared/admin-page.php on line 58</p>
