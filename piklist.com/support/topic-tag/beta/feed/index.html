										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I wanted to make it more obvious that we currently are working on the <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/releases">0.10 release</a>. This is a pretty major release as a good amount of code was refactored and a lot of bugs that were plaguing users have been vanquished. We really hope you test this out so we can release it as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> When you install this version <em>do not simply overwrite the existing plugin</em> as that will leave existing files that shouldn&#8217;t be there and will cause issues. Instead, delete (or rename to piklist.old if you want to switch back later) the piklist folder completely and then drop in the new plugin in its place.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re pretty excited about this as it&#8217;s our first release done from <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist">Github</a> and we already have merged in community contributions. Please get involved, when testing make an <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/issues">issue</a> on Github (not here), and dive into the code and make <a href="https://github.com/piklist/piklist/pulls">pull requests</a>!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>WordPress multisite with Piklist 0.9.9.11 (network activated) and a custom made plugin which creates custom taxonomy and custom post type (network activated as well).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress multisite with Piklist 0.9.9.11 (network activated) and a custom made plugin which creates custom taxonomy and custom post type (network activated as well). Whenever custom post type is either created or edited there&#8217;s an admin error saying:</p>
<p><code>Undefined index: order in &quot;XXXXXX/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist.php&quot;, line 2007</code></p>
<p>On a side note, there&#8217;s a clause at the line #2007 (class-piklist.php):</p>
<pre><code>
if( ! isset( $a[ &#039;args&#039; ][ &#039;order&#039; ] ) &amp;&amp; ! isset ($b[ &#039;args&#039; ][ &#039;order&#039; ] ) )</code></pre>
<p>&#8230; but somehow I think it should be:</p>
<p><code>if( ! isset( $a[ &#039;args&#039; ][ &#039;order&#039; ] ) || ! isset ($b[ &#039;args&#039; ][ &#039;order&#039; ] ) )</code></p>
<p>&#8230;because if either of these two evaluates true then the function itself returns error &#8211; an undefined index &#8216;order&#8217;.</p>
<p>Piklist welcome back, hopefully you live again but not as a zombie plugin <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I want to start my big project on piklist. I see in some topics that authors promised many new things in new version, but it still in beta. How hard will be converting actual version to new version? Will sites based on current version work with new?</p>
