										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have this beautiful new Publish box that I created, and it worked only when Piklist Demos was active. This happen on my dev environment, and in messing around, I got it to work by changing the name of the file while Piklist Demos were active, It then worked when I deactivated the demos.</p>
<p>When I pushed the changes up to staging I have the same issue again and changing the name doesn&#8217;t resolve it (likely it&#8217;s not the thing that resolved it before, it just happened to coincide with whatever else I did that actually solved it.)</p>
<p>WP Multisite 4.8.1<br />
Piklist 9.9.12</p>
<p>So, in staging, the custom Publish box works consistently while Piklist Demos are active, and goes back to the default publish box when Piklist Demos are deactivated.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my header block:</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Publish
Extend: submitdiv
Extend Method: replace
Context: side
Priority: core
Post Type: pro-cards
*/</code></pre>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, you say Piklist can &#8220;Customize everything in WordPress&#8221;. I wonder how can I remove unwanted fields from default WordPress Post Type or User Profile. In other words: is it possible rather than add fields only to remove fields?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m trying to duplicate what was done in Piklist Demos, where you move built-in meta-boxes to specific tabs. In particular, I tried to move the default editor so that it shows up in only one tab: /* Title: Post Format Post Type: post Flow: Post Flow Tab: Write Meta Box: false Extend: postdivrich Extend Method: [&#8230;]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m trying to duplicate what was done in Piklist Demos, where you move built-in meta-boxes to specific tabs. In particular, I tried to move the default editor so that it shows up in only one tab: </p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Post Format
Post Type: post
Flow: Post Flow
Tab: Write
Meta Box: false
Extend: postdivrich
Extend Method: after
*/
</code></pre>
<p>and to move the Post Formats box to a tab called &#8220;Organize:&#8221;</p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Post Format
Post Type: post
Flow: Post Flow
Tab: Organize
Meta Box: true
Extend: formatdiv
Extend Method: before
*/
</code></pre>
<p>For the latter, since it wanted to stay in the right column, I also tried adding <code>Context: normal</code>, but that didn&#8217;t make a difference. </p>
<p>At least I was able to successfully extend the Post Formats box with comment text, so I know it was reading my meta-boxes. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to use Extend, so I activated Piklist Demos and copied a few of the files to my own plugin. I have my own workflow for post type &#8220;post,&#8221; and wanted to move several meta-boxes, including Post Formats, into a tab called &#8220;Organize:&#8221; /* Title: Post Format Post Type: post [&#8230;]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to use Extend, so I activated Piklist Demos and copied a few of the files to my own plugin. </p>
<p>I have my own workflow for post type &#8220;post,&#8221; and wanted to move several meta-boxes, including Post Formats, into a tab called &#8220;Organize:&#8221; </p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Post Format
Post Type: post
Flow: Post Flow
Tab: Organize
Meta Box: true
Extend: formatdiv
Extend Method: before
*/</code></pre>
<p>When I do that, the meta-box displays the extended text that is being added in <code>piklist-demos/parts/meta-boxes/extend-post-formats-after.php</code> and <code>extend-post-formats-after.php</code>. This is despite the fact that I&#8217;m editing a post and those meta-boxes are only for <code>Post Type: piklist-demo</code>. (Well, &#8220;after&#8221; is for pages as well, but this isn&#8217;t a page.) </p>
<pre><code>/*
Title: Post Formats... extended by Piklist
Post Type: piklist_demo
Flow: Demo Workflow
Tab: Extend
Meta Box: true
Extend: formatdiv
Extend Method: before
*/</code></pre>
<p>If my extension is removed, the post format box is displayed normally. So evidently if the box is extended for one post type, then extensions for other post types are also applied. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, just set up my first workflows and I LOVE how they clean up the edit page. Now I&#8217;m wondering if I can take the Yoast metabox and put it into its own SEO tab. I&#8217;m sure Piklist can do it but am scratching my head about where to start. Suggestions? Thanks! Donna</p>
