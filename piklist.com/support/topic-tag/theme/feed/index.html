										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m new PHP / wordpress and I have to admit I&#8217;m struggling. The idea is to be able to create a bunch of reusable content aka content blocks. When creating a new post or page I want to be able to select which content blocks to display along side it.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve created the CPT:</p>
<pre><code>&#039;content_blocks&#039; =&gt; array(
&#039;labels&#039; =&gt; piklist(&#039;post_type_labels&#039;, &#039;Content Block&#039;)
,&#039;supports&#039; =&gt; array(
&#039;title&#039;
)
,&#039;public&#039; =&gt; false
,&#039;show_ui&#039; =&gt; true
,&#039;publicly_queryable&#039; =&gt; false
,&#039;exclude_from_search&#039; =&gt; true
,&#039;has_archive&#039; =&gt; false
,&#039;hide_screen_options&#039; =&gt; true
)</code></pre>
<p>And I&#8217;ve attached some fields to it like:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;
,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;block_img&#039;
));</code></pre>
<p>And</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;editor&#039;
,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_content&#039;
,&#039;template&#039; =&gt; &#039;field&#039;
));</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve also created an addmore select field that lists the published content block CPTs. It allows me to choose multiple content blocks and arrange their order. I have attached it to posts and pages:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;select&#039;
,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;attach_blocks&#039;
,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Add content blocks&#039;
,&#039;add_more&#039; =&gt; true
,&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; piklist(
get_posts(
array(
&#039;post_type&#039; =&gt; &#039;content_blocks&#039;
,&#039;orderby&#039; =&gt; &#039;ID&#039;
,&#039;order&#039; =&gt; &#039;asc&#039;
)
,&#039;objects&#039;
)
,array(
&#039;ID&#039;
,&#039;post_title&#039;
)
)
));</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. Now I&#8217;m struggling to figure out how to display the content blocks in my theme&#8217;s sidebar (outside the post&#8217;s loop). It needs to display the title, main content and associated meta fields. Does anyone have any tips or code examples that might help me get started? Is this even the best way to go about it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really stuck. I just can&#8217;t seem to get my Piklist editor values to show in replace of the default WordPress values. Have looked through the forums which point me to the get_post_meta in WordPress help, but it&#8217;s just not helping.</p>
<p>I have created my demo_metabox.php file.<br />
And within it have created a text field:<br />
piklist(&#8216;field&#8217;, array(<br />
    &#8216;type&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;text&#8217;<br />
    ,&#8217;field&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;subtitle&#8217;<br />
    ,&#8217;label&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;Subtitle Text Box&#8217;<br />
    ,&#8217;description&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;Enter the year of birth here&#8217;<br />
    ,&#8217;value&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;Default text&#8217;<br />
    ,&#8217;help&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;Example: b.1940&#8242;<br />
    ,&#8217;attributes&#8217; =&gt; array(<br />
      &#8216;class&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;text&#8217;<br />
    )<br />
  ));<br />
This is working, it now shows in the editor.<br />
Great. Happy with this.</p>
<p>In single.php I have called my custom fields in the same way I would normally.</p>
<p>&lt;?php<br />
$subtitle= get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, &#8216;demo_subtitle&#8217;, true);<br />
?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;?php if($subtitle){?&gt;<br />
   &lt;h3&gt;&lt;?php echo $subtitle;?&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;?php } ?&gt;</p>
<p>This returns nothing.<br />
I just can&#8217;t move forward until I figure out how to get the values coming through.</p>
<p>Please help!<br />
Cheers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a heads up Kevin, the windows situation (yeah, I know you love this. :-))<br />
with having piklist parts inside the theme folder doesn&#8217;t work with the latest version of piklist. </p>
<p>So I found a solution. </p>
<p>Apparently in the themes path check in class-piklist.php around lines 200 or so.<br />
The self::$paths[$_theme] produces the full theme path but adds in the folder /piklist to the end, while the $_part variable also adds /piklist to the beginning of all parts, making sure nothing loads from the themes piklist folder.</p>
<p>I removed the themes additional piklist folder from its path, and voila. Works.<br />
I changed the following:</p>
<pre><code>
        foreach (array(&#039;theme&#039;, &#039;parent-theme&#039;) as $_theme)
        {
          $spt = self::$paths[$_theme];
          $spt = substr($spt,0,strlen($spt)-8); // EDITED BY MARCUS
          if (isset($spt))
          {
            if (file_exists($spt . $_part))
            {
              $_file = $spt . $_part;
              break;
            }
          }
        }
        // d($_file);
        if (file_exists($_file))
        {
          break;
        }
</code></pre>
