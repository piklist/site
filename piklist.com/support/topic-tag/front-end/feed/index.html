<p>Does piklist include anything comparable to ACF&#8217;s the_field function?</p>
<p>Or does it concern itself mostly with getting data in, and we should use get_post_meta and worry about how the field is rendered ourselves?</p>
<p>(I see in the documentation piklist provides helpers for registering shortcodes and widgets.)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in desperate need of a solution for this. I have a multi-page front end form with many different required file uploads.</p>
<p>Piklist does a fine job of making sure you can&#8217;t move to the next page without submitting the required info. However, when you go back to that page after advancing in to process, you can see that the image is stored here&#8230;</p>
<p><img src='https://s30.postimg.org/jlka8g89t/Screen_Shot_2017_01_26_at_10_10_37_AM.png' border='0' alt="Screen Shot 2017-01-26 at 10.10.37 AM" /></p>
<p>But when you attempt to move on again, it acts as if it doesn&#8217;t know the file exists (despite the fact that you&#8217;re looking at a preview).</p>
<p><img src="https://s28.postimg.org/mqvabaa7x/Screen_Shot_2017_01_26_at_10_29_33_AM.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working at this for a while, looking for ways to even work around Piklist for this one input type, but I&#8217;m not having any luck getting it integrated back into the Piklist flow.</p>
<p>HELP!!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,  </p>
<p>It seems that currently Piklist can&#8217;t show the uploaded image preview on a front end form before submitting it.<br />
It also seems that you can&#8217;t control the limit of the amount of repeated field gropus (Add More fields) in the front end form, again, before submitting it.</p>
<p>For a frontend form those features are crucial. In fact without them the front end form in some cases is useless.</p>
<p>The user should be able to see a preview of the image in the frontend before submitting. Also the form should limit the amount of group fields before submitting, not after.</p>
<p>Is there a way to achieve that with extra programming? Is there a hook or something, or even a way using Javascript to add those two features?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not asking for a solution, but just a guideline or just point me in which direction should I go to achieve this.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Enrique</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using 0.9.9.8. In 0.9.5v, the new ID showed up in a hidden ID field, but now that field is empty: </p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(

	&#039;required&#039; =&gt; false,
));
</code></pre>
<p>I tried the new-post-with-validation.php form in piklist-demos, but its $_POST results don&#8217;t include an ID field. </p>
<p>Thanks for any clues as I&#8217;ve been banging my head on this for an hour! </p>

<p>Anyway, I tried to change how error notice and stuff looks like on the front end, but it seems the Piklist css placement on footer is going to be major obstacle for me trying to customize it.</p>
<p>I tried to manually override it with custom css, also on footer, but it seems there&#8217;s a significant lag before my custom css takes place.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&#8217;s any way to deactivate Piklist css only on front end? Thanks!</p>

<p>I added the <code>scope</code> fields as without them I couldn&#8217;t use the condition for <code>order_id</code>. </p>
<p>Problem: when I submit the form, I get the following order message:</p>
<pre><code>
Notice: Undefined index: post in /Users/donna/Sites/bentonswcd/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist-form.php on line 3028
</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;m running Piklist 0.9.9.6, and that line is: </p>
<pre><code>
$field[&#039;object_id&#039;] = $field[&#039;object_id&#039;] ? $field[&#039;object_id&#039;] : $object_ids[$meta_type];
</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;m really baffled. If I change the post comments to use <code>Method: get</code> instead of post, I don&#8217;t get the error message but I get a really ugly URL. </p>
<p>Any clues where I&#8217;m goofing up?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first post! New to Piklist, but years deep in ACF/CMB2. I&#8217;m becoming a convert <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I have a front end form to create a CPT. All works fine, including setting a featured image. The only thing not working is file upload field validation and default WP media uploader.</p>
<p>My field is:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
  &#039;type&#039;        =&gt; &#039;file&#039;,
  &#039;scope&#039;       =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;,
  &#039;field&#039;       =&gt; &#039;_thumbnail_id&#039;,
  &#039;label&#039;       =&gt; __(&#039;Featured Image&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;),
  &#039;options&#039;     =&gt; array(
    &#039;modal_title&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add File(s)&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;),
    &#039;button&#039;      =&gt; __(&#039;Add&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;),
  ),
  &#039;validate&#039; =&gt; array(
    array(
      &#039;type&#039;    =&gt; &#039;limit&#039;,
      &#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
        &#039;min&#039;     =&gt; 1,
        &#039;max&#039;     =&gt; 1,
      ),
    ),
    array(
      &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;image&#039;,
    ),
  ),
));
</code></pre>
<p>It&#8217;s still showing the basic uploader and it&#8217;s still allowing me to upload zip and php (non-image) files.<br />
I&#8217;m using version 0.9.9.7<br />
Thanks!</p>
