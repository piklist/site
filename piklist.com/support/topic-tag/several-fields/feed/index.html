										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to wrap my head around this, playing around with the code and I can&#8217;t make it work.</p>
<p>I need to reveal a group of fields when a check box is ticked. I&#8217;ve got the label:<br />
Address is different than Sign up Address</p>
<p>If the box is checked than new address fields show up: Street1, Street2, City, State, Zip.</p>
<p>I can make a single field show up, no problem, but not several. I get an error when that happens. I can&#8217;t find documentation for this. Can someone point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
