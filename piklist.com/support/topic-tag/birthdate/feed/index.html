										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello!<br />
I&#8217;m relatively new to Piklist and a novice coder taking on an ambitious project. Learning as I go. Yay.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m stumbling on this:</p>
<p>I have a profile for a child and there is a birthday field on the submission form. The datepicker doesn&#8217;t seem to be the right tool for the job so I&#8217;m going to use fields for day, month and year.<br />
Each child will can be signed up to an activity which is age specific, meaning that there is a cut off age. The activity form will have fields for age limit (min and max). I am somehow going to connect the activity post type to the child and I need an alert or error message if the age isn&#8217;t appropriate to the age range set in the activity.</p>
<p>1. If there is a field type &#8220;date&#8221; in Piklist.<br />
2. How I should go about triggering the alert or error message. My idea it to conditionally show the alert by pulling the month &amp; year variable from the Activity profile and comparing to month &amp; year variable for the child and having an error message if outside the range. Is this something that&#8217;s doable? Or is there a whole bunch of PHP timestamp stuff I need to look into to make things more dynamic.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
