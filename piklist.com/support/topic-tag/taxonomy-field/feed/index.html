										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a custom post type that I have created with a custom taxonomy attached to it. I have created a meta box with a select field that pulls in all the terms from the custom tax which display correctly. The problem I am having is that when saving the post it doesn&#8217;t seem to save the correct data as the select field is just defaulting back to the first option once the page reloads.</p>
<p>If I use post_meta as the scope everything works correctly however there is no relation between that data and the taxonomy which is no good for me. I used the exact code in the tutorial with the modifications I needed for my data.</p>
<p>Is this a bug or is there something I am missing? I hope this all makes sense.</p>
<p>Here is my code <a href="http://pastebin.com/eExhdadF" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/eExhdadF</a></p>
