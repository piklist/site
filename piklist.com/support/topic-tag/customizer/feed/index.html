					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I&#8217;ve searched and found several posts mentioning the Customizer isn&#8217;t supported, then one saying it is. Last week, it was working for me. I used it to upload a favicon to a site I&#8217;m developing. This week, it&#8217;s no longer working. Is it currently supported or not? Thanks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I use Piklist 0.9.9.9 and the Customizer in my project and when I change some options and save, Piklist Break the Customizer and all my options are not available anymore.</p>
<p>I can reproduce this bug on a clean WP install with only Piklist activated ( CPT demo enabled) and the Twenty Sixteen theme. </p>
<p>For instance, add a new image to the header background, save and reload the page. All the customizer options disappear.</p>
<p>Firebug shows some JS errors coming from Piklist (can&#8217;t find dashicons font?).<br />
See my screenshot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am using the latest version of Wp and running the genesis framework. The customizer in multiple child themes offered by Studiopress is not working. I also have a plugin with a few widgets I created and a few settings pages. When I delete the widgets the customizer comes back. The setting are not affecting anything. I have attached a screenshot of the errors I am getting in the console when the widgets are active on the customizer page. It does this when any widget is added to the widgets folder.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m using WordPress 4.5.2. The problem I&#8217;ve found is that no matter what fixes or libraries or plugins I employ, the WordPress Customizer won&#8217;t work with the Image upload control. I&#8217;ve tried implementing the Image upload control using standard WordPress procedures as the codex suggests but all in vain. I&#8217;ve tried using the popular Kirki toolkit for the same but still to no avail. After a long search, I came across the Customizer library and have tried a number of times to make it work but still to no avail. I&#8217;ve tried using the WP-Customize-Image-Reloaded php script but still to no avail too. Today, I decided to investigate if the plugins aren&#8217;t the cause of the bug that breaks the Customizer each time an Image upload control is added in the code. I&#8217;ve deactivated all the plugins and the Customizer worked fine. I then started activating the plugins one by one while running the checking th Customizer to see if one of them breaks it. To my dismay, Piklist was the one that was breaking the Customizer. When I activate Piklist,the Customizer will either display nothing in the left pane or will display nothing in the left pane and then display gibberish text and input fields in the preview window bottom. When I upgrade to Pikist 0.9.9.8, the Customizer goes blank without any controls. The attached image can give you an idea of how it looks like. All this happens as long as an Image upload control  field is added in the code that is run by the Customizer. Whether it is added using standard procedure, or using a library like the Customizer library by Devin Price. Even when using the popular Kirki toolkit, the Customizer breaks if one of the controls is an Image upload control. Remove the Image upload control from the code, the Customizer runs. Put it back, it breaks. I&#8217;ve tried testing other controls like the textarea, color pickers, the media uploader, and some others and the Customizer works except for the Image upload control. I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that the problem is infact inside Piklist because it&#8217;s the one that breaks the Customizer. I&#8217;ve even tried fixing the issue using the <code>context</code> arg as specified in the codex and even read tutorials to rule out possibilities of me being ignorant about the way things work; But still the Image upload control breaks the customizer as long as it&#8217;s there in the code and Piklist is running/active. Now I&#8217;m here asking for your help people to make this work. The greater part of my project is run by Piklist. Redoing allover again what I&#8217;ve already accomplished with Piklist using another alternative to Piklist is my most dreaded nightmare. I love Piklist and I want to continue using it for it took me some time to decide about taking it up. Besides, it&#8217;s the best framework out there. Until then, I&#8217;m stuck and only counting on your help to move forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WordPress.org Now Requires Theme Authors to Use the Customizer to Build Theme Options</strong></p>
<p>WordPress.org has mandated there be NO settings API based option panels of any kind for themes hosted on WordPress.org. Existing themes still using option panels will be required to remove said panels and add customizer ONLY options before updating. New themes must adhere to this new guideline, or be rejected. The WordPress.org theme review team has essentially stopped WordPress.org theme devs from using most option frameworks.</p>
