										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not a support request, but I just wanted to let you know how easy Piklist has made developing my first plugin. I am used to working with PHP frameworks, and wordpress seemed so loose for me. Piklist closed that gap and brought me to production real fast! I wonder why this wasn&#8217;t developed by the WP team in the first place!</p>
<p>My plugin is a one-click LinkedIn login solution for wordpress that allows users to login to WP via their linkedin credentials. You can take a look here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/linkedin-login/</p>
<p>By the way, is there any directory of Piklist-based plugins, or anyway to determine which plugins have been built on top of Piklist? </p>
