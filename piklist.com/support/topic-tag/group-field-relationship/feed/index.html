										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have 2 CPTs &#8211; Job Advertisement and Role. Each Job advertisement (or a notice) can have multiple roles.  </p>
<p>I am trying to create a admin form for job notice which will allow me to add multiple roles (in place) to a job notice. I am using group field to do this. There is a demo for group related which adds multiple posts to a demo (wp-content/plugins/piklist/add-ons/piklist-demos/parts/meta-boxes/field-relationship.php). </p>
<p>The demo works regular posts. I cannot get it working for a custom post type.</p>
<p>here&#8217;s my code :</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
/*
Title: My custom fields
Post Type: job_notice
*/
?&gt;

&lt;?php

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, [
	&#039;type&#039; =&gt;   &#039;group&#039;,
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt;  &#039;Add Role&#039;,
	&#039;relate&#039; =&gt;  array(&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;),
	&#039;add_more&#039; =&gt; true,
	&#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
		array(&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;hidden&#039;, &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_type&#039;, &#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;role&#039;, &#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;),
		array(&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;hidden&#039;, &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_status&#039;, &#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;publish&#039;, &#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;),
		array(&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;, &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_title&#039;, &#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Role Name&#039;, &#039;columns&#039; =&gt; 6, &#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;),
		array(&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;number&#039;,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;number_of_posts&#039; ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Number Of Posts&#039;, &#039;columns&#039; =&gt; 3, &#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;)
	)
]);
</code></pre>
<p>I expect to create roles having fields &#8211; post_status, post_title, number_of_posts that are related to the parent job_notice.</p>
<p>What I get &#8211; Roles get created with fields: post_status, post_title.<br />
The field number_of_posts gets saved as a job_notice field inside its post_meta.</p>
<p>Also the add mores do no retain the entered values and show the text boxes as empty.</p>
<p>Is this a bug with field relationships ? Can you add some tutorial on group / relationship fields. The fields documentation page says &#8220;coming soon&#8221; at https://piklist.com/learn/doc/relationships/. It is really hard to implement CPT &#8211; CPT relationship similar to the one that demo shows.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
