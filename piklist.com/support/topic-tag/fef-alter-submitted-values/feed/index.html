										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am attempting to create a custom user registration front end form.<br />
I would like to validate some fields and change some fields upon submission /before/ they are saved to the db.</p>
<p>Attempting to use the <code>piklist_save_fields</code> action gets a nasty data structure internal to piklist that has all of the submitted field contents.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want my code to have to depend on understanding that structure.<br />
Is there a straight-forward way to subscribe to a specific form submission, and get access to modify the $_REQUEST before piklist does its thing?</p>
<p>E.g., I want to set username = md5(email) or maybe just esc_text(email).<br />
I also want to force the role to &#8221; (empty), so I have it as a hidden piklist, but obviously don&#8217;t want to allow someone to elevate their role.</p>
<p>The documentation has a list of filters, but not of the actions inside piklist. I found it by grepping.</p>
