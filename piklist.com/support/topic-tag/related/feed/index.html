										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, I have a fairly complicated site built atop Piklist. I have been storing repeating groups of (add more) data (in the postmeta table) along with the custom post types I have built. And I need a more reliable way than index to get at these groups for editing and updating. I would have liked to have used grouped fields (serialized in the db), but because my groupings have many conditional values, this won&#8217;t currently work in Piklist (<a href="https://piklist.com/support/topic/grouped-conditionals-not-working/">see this link</a>).</p>
<p>So here are my questions to solve this:<br />
1. Could I store these groups in their own post type and relate them to the parent CPT?<br />
2. If so, is there a way to allow these child posts to both display AND be editable from within the parent in admin?</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice or help!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy. Been testing relationship fields and have stumbled a bit. </p>
<p>Use case:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a custom post type &#8216;workshop&#8217; and I made the posts available on the user edit screen as a relationship which works:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;select&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;user_relate_post&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Relate Posts&#039;, &#039;piklist-demo&#039;)
	,&#039;attributes&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;multiple&#039; =&gt; &#039;multiple&#039; // Allow a select field to accept multiple selections
    )
    ,&#039;choices&#039; =&gt; piklist(
      get_posts(array(
        &#039;post_type&#039; =&gt; &#039;workshop&#039;
        ,&#039;numberposts&#039; =&gt; -1
        ,&#039;orderby&#039; =&gt; &#039;title&#039;
        ,&#039;order&#039; =&gt; &#039;ASC&#039;
      ))
      ,array(&#039;ID&#039;, &#039;post_title&#039;)
    )
    ,&#039;relate&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
    )
  ));</code></pre>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to do now is display all users for a specific workshop. For example if a few users have &#8216;workshop 101&#8217; selected on their pages -&gt; show those users on the &#8216;workshop 101&#8217; page. And vice versa.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried the basic functions but can&#8217;t seem to figure it out. Anyone have ideas? Is it possible?</p>
