										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I created a new install of WordPress with no plugins active. I added Piklist. I started to play with creating a CPT, that worked. I then tried to add a second CPT to the same file, and it failed. So I backed that out, and it was back to working. I thought I would look at some of the add-ons to check out the code, but the add-ons page didn&#8217;t have the box to make selections, tried the settings page, it too was messed up, nothing shows to the right of the labels, just blank space.  Thinking something might be messed up with WordPress, I blew that install away and created a new install and did the same thing of adding in Piklist, this time I didn&#8217;t try to create anything, I just went into the settings page, nothing displays. I thought it might have something to do with WordPress since it is the latest version 5.4, but I have another site with 5.4 (same hosting company) and Piklist works correctly there. This is a totally new install of WordPress, there are no conflicting plugins only Akismet is installed, but it is not activated. So what the heck could be going on? </p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
