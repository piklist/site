										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to some problems with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), I&#8217;m starting to convert several sites from ACF to Piklist. With simple fields the translation is straightforward, and some sites are small enough to just manually create the new data. But I do have a few sites with large amounts of the repeater data, so I&#8217;m planning to use a script. Has anyone out there already created such a script that you&#8217;d like to share? Or who is starting the process and would be interested in collaboration? </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using Rilwis&#8217; Meta Box Library for quite a while (over a year in one particular theme). http://www.deluxeblogtips.com/meta-box/</p>
<p>We have a lot of custom post types created manually and have several meta boxes attached to these custom post types. I have looked at Piklist and it does look interesting however I am concerned about being able to migrate so not to lose existing data held within posts.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
