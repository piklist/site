										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is my challenge.  When you look at Piklist&#8217;s demo settings page under the lists&#8217; tab, it has controls well organized with the title field you describe in the comment block beautifully introducing and categorizing the controls. Refer to the attached image. These titles seem to be separate individual settings files fully populated with the desired fields, that are all called on one page by simply assigning them to that particular tab in the comment block. At least that is how I&#8217;ve been able to replicate that behavior on my side.  The challenge here, at least in my case is that the last created settings file is the one that shows up at the top of all other settings on that particular tab. Is there a way to determine the order in which the output of these settings files shows up on their respective tab? Take for example in the attached image, suppose I wanted to make the  <em>Checkbox Fields</em> section show first at the top, then <em>Select Fields</em> section next and lastly the <em>Multiselect Fields</em> section. How would I go about that? I don&#8217;t seem to find it anywhere in the Piklist documentation.</p>
