										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys!;</p>
<p>I have a website that plays music by connecting with SoundCloud via Ajax to get a playable stream.</p>
<p>In this way users can complete a form created with Piklist to publish their music on our website.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m having a problem because the form created with Piklist says “Request failed: error” when a SoundCloud link is pasted into the field designated for that.</p>
<p>Everything was working perfectly until just a few weeks ago, I thought that it would be resolved with an update or that it was perhaps a conflict with some other plugin but I have uninstalled one by one and none of these changes.</p>
<p>Please help me, Thanks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,<br />
I need to prepare a form.<br />
Admins needs to enter post title, attach thumbnail image,<br />
select taxonomy. Based on selected taxonomy,<br />
I need to make a WP_Query and on submit, it attached the post ids returned from WP_Query to the post_meta.<br />
Following is my github gist for the form.<br />
https://gist.github.com/vineettalwar/855a93b45b16163b31bb54af0a2b8dc3<br />
I need to read selected taxonomy term id, then pass that term id to on_submit_query function (written at the end of the file.). it shall return post ids from that WP_Query and I need to simply update that id array to newly created post at a post meta key post_ids_key</p>
<p>1) Could you please tell me how can I achieve that ?<br />
2) Every time a new post is created, is there any way it can be checked, if post exists then, update the post only in piklist. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in desperate need of a solution for this. I have a multi-page front end form with many different required file uploads.</p>
<p>Piklist does a fine job of making sure you can&#8217;t move to the next page without submitting the required info. However, when you go back to that page after advancing in to process, you can see that the image is stored here&#8230;</p>
<p><img src='https://s30.postimg.org/jlka8g89t/Screen_Shot_2017_01_26_at_10_10_37_AM.png' border='0' alt="Screen Shot 2017-01-26 at 10.10.37 AM" /></p>
<p>But when you attempt to move on again, it acts as if it doesn&#8217;t know the file exists (despite the fact that you&#8217;re looking at a preview).</p>
<p><img src="https://s28.postimg.org/mqvabaa7x/Screen_Shot_2017_01_26_at_10_29_33_AM.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working at this for a while, looking for ways to even work around Piklist for this one input type, but I&#8217;m not having any luck getting it integrated back into the Piklist flow.</p>
<p>HELP!!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using 0.9.9.8. In 0.9.5v, the new ID showed up in a hidden ID field, but now that field is empty: </p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(

	&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;ID&#039;,

	&#039;required&#039; =&gt; false,
));
</code></pre>
<p>I tried the new-post-with-validation.php form in piklist-demos, but its $_POST results don&#8217;t include an ID field. </p>
<p>Thanks for any clues as I&#8217;ve been banging my head on this for an hour! </p>

<p>I added the <code>scope</code> fields as without them I couldn&#8217;t use the condition for <code>order_id</code>. </p>
<p>Problem: when I submit the form, I get the following order message:</p>
<pre><code>
Notice: Undefined index: post in /Users/donna/Sites/bentonswcd/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist-form.php on line 3028
</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;m running Piklist 0.9.9.6, and that line is: </p>
<pre><code>
$field[&#039;object_id&#039;] = $field[&#039;object_id&#039;] ? $field[&#039;object_id&#039;] : $object_ids[$meta_type];
</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;m really baffled. If I change the post comments to use <code>Method: get</code> instead of post, I don&#8217;t get the error message but I get a really ugly URL. </p>
<p>Any clues where I&#8217;m goofing up?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<p>It&#8217;s still showing the basic uploader and it&#8217;s still allowing me to upload zip and php (non-image) files.<br />
