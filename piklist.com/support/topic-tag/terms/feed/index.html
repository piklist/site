										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using piklist beta 0.9.9.6</p>
<p>I am trying to create a field for category so I have followed the instruction as provided in documentation and created a file my-terms-cat.php under themefolder/piklist/parts/terms/<br />
The code is as follows: &#8211; </p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
/*
Title: My Term Metabox
Description: My cool new metabox
Taxonomy: category
Capability: manage_options
Locked: true
New: true
Collapse: true
*/
 
// Let&#039;s create a text box field
 piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
   &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;
   ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;field_name008&#039;
   ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Example Field&#039;)
   ,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Field Description&#039;)
   ,&#039;attributes&#039; =&gt; array(
     &#039;class&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;
   )
 ));
 ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>But field is not showing during creation of a new category. When I make New: false, it starts showing while editing a category, but what should I do if I want to show it during new category creation? I have attached an image to understand it better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! How do i connect multiple taxonomies in a post? Lets say i have a post called business and i have 3 taxonomies for the post type business which are countries, cities and states.</p>
<p>Inside my business post type i would like to only show cities if a country is selected and only show cities connected to the selected countries.</p>
<p>I know i could do this by using 1 taxonomy called location but if you are to put lots of countries cities and state it can be hard to manage. so instead i would like to separate them into 3 taxonomy.</p>
<p>I know piklist is very flexible that i can add a field inside a term like to select another taxonomy as its parent. But I have no idea of how to do this.</p>
<p>I would also like to show this taxonomies inside the business post type post but would like it to be like a step by step feature. like if in the country i select japan.</p>
<p>the city or state metabox will show up but only show terms that is associated with the japan country.</p>
<p>I hope someone can guide me on how to do this. Thanks!</p>

That float property should be overridden to &#8220;none&#8221; in the context of taxonomy fields UI.</p>
<p>Date/time fields seem to have their style inlined in the html.</p>
<p>This problem can be reproduced with custom terms fields of one of those two types.</p>

But, I would love to see it in PikList. May be something like /* Title: Region Information Taxonomy: region Order: 20 */ Thanks</p>
