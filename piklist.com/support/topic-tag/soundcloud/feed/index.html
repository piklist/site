										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys!;</p>
<p>I have a website that plays music by connecting with SoundCloud via Ajax to get a playable stream.</p>
<p>In this way users can complete a form created with Piklist to publish their music on our website.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m having a problem because the form created with Piklist says “Request failed: error” when a SoundCloud link is pasted into the field designated for that.</p>
<p>Everything was working perfectly until just a few weeks ago, I thought that it would be resolved with an update or that it was perhaps a conflict with some other plugin but I have uninstalled one by one and none of these changes.</p>
<p>Please help me, Thanks!</p>
