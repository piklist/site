<blockquote><p>Warning: Missing argument 3 for PikList_CPT::save_post() in /home/content/companyname/wp-content/plugins/piklist/includes/class-piklist-cpt.php on line 500</p></blockquote>
<p>Wondering if this is a known bug.<br />
I really want to help these guys, (IE: Get paid. LOL) but I want to use piklist to solve their problems without adding ANY MORE third party CRAP. Are there any known conflicts with any plugins combined with this version of WP? I can post all the plugins they use.</p>
<p>Also, is there a variable now being used in WP, that wasn&#8217;t in 3.5? (the missing 3rd parameter error)</p>
<p>Pre-thanks to the Piklist team.</p>

<p>Install new WP 3.5. Add piklist without the demos addon turned on.  Insert some photos into media browser, go to pages-&gt;add new. Click insert media, and you&#8217;ll see your photos from the media library.  Now go to the piklist settings and turn on the demos add on.  Go back to pages-&gt;add new and click insert media. None of the images from the media gallery show up.</p>
<p>This is the behavior on my MAMP localhost, php 5.4.3</p>
<p>Edit. </p>
<p>Forgot to mention that, I previously had the 3.5 RCs installed and didn&#8217;t notice that this was happening but it might have been.</p>
