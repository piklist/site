										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had this issue back in 0.9.9.4 but seemed to have been resolved after I updated to 0.9.9.6. Again I find that I cannot really work the media upload. The symptoms are odd. Upon creating a new post it will let me upload using the media modal native to WordPress. Then its locked out for the most part. When I try to remove and update the post &#8211; it remains. I can upload more without a problem and I can remove the second onward, but never the first one that I uploaded. I am pulling my hair (*what&#8217;s left of it) at this point. </p>
<p>This is the meta-box I setup:</p>
<pre><code> piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_header_banner&#039;
    ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add File(s)&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    ,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Upload Top Banner.&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    ,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;modal_title&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add Banner Image&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
      ,&#039;button&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add Banner&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    )
    ,&#039;validate&#039; =&gt; array(
	  array(
	    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;limit&#039;,
	    &#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
	      &#039;min&#039; =&gt; 0,
	      &#039;max&#039; =&gt; 2
	    )
	  )
	)
  ));
  
  
  	 piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;file&#039;
    ,&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_title_banner&#039;
    ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_meta&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add File(s)&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    ,&#039;description&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Upload Title Banner.&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    ,&#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;modal_title&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add Title Image&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
      ,&#039;button&#039; =&gt; __(&#039;Add Title&#039;,&#039;piklist&#039;)
    )
    
    ,&#039;validate&#039; =&gt; array(
	  array(
	    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;limit&#039;,
	    &#039;options&#039; =&gt; array(
	      &#039;min&#039; =&gt; 0,
	      &#039;max&#039; =&gt; 1
	    )
	  )
	)
    
  ));
</code></pre>
<p>If I go into the database I can see the postmeta section with the <code>post_header_banner</code> populated with the image ID of the first image. From here I can put in another ID and it updates nicely without a hitch. </p>
<p>I read through the forums and found that some people were experiencing similar issues with far more complex setups than what I am doing. I even added the limits to see if setting the <code>min</code> but no dice!</p>
<p>Then I figured it had something to do with not being explicit with setting capability on the <code>meta-box</code> file. Nope. </p>
<p>I turned off all the plugins to make sure they weren&#8217;t conflicting. Nothing.</p>
<p>I already went back in time to the previous releases, including the one still posted as the current release on WordPress Plugins section. </p>
