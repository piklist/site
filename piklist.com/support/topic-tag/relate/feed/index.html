										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The docs are great if you know PHP, if not they may as well be written in moon-speak. I struggled to get the relate field to print out a nice list of links in my theme. The example in the docs just prints out the post titles &#8211; no urls / permalinks. Here&#8217;s how I managed to do it.</p>
<p>First, create your field-</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
/*
Title: Add links to other useful posts
Post Type: post
*/

piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;post-relate&#039;
,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
,&#039;template&#039; =&gt; &#039;field&#039;
));</code></pre>
<p>Next, go ahead and create a test post and add some related posts to your new field.</p>
<p>Now open up the theme file that displays your single posts (single.php). You&#8217;ll find some moon-speak similar to the following: </p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
// Start the loop.
while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();

// Some more moon-speak that prints out the post - removed for brevity. 
			
// End of the loop.
endwhile; ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Before the end of your post loop, add the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php         
$related = get_posts(array(
&#039;post_type&#039; =&gt; &#039;posts&#039; // Set post type you are relating to.
,&#039;posts_per_page&#039; =&gt; -1
,&#039;post_belongs&#039; =&gt; $post-&gt;ID
,&#039;post_status&#039; =&gt; &#039;publish&#039;
,&#039;suppress_filters&#039; =&gt; false // This must be set to false
));
?&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;?php foreach($related as $related_post) {
echo &#039;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&#039;.get_post_permalink($related_post-&gt;ID).&#039;&quot;&gt;&#039;.$related_post-&gt;post_title.&#039;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#039;;
} ?&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Viola! A nice list of links to your related posts. Please note this doesn&#8217;t work outside of the main post loop. So no trying to stick it in your sidebar. If anyone knows how to get this to work outside of the loop, I&#8217;d love to know!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to copy/modify the demo code that shows how you can use a repeater field to create related Posts/Users/Comments on the edit form of the Demo custom-post-type.</p>
<p><code>meta-boxes/field-relationship.php</code></p>
<pre><code>
  piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
    &#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;group&#039;
    ,&#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
    ,&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Related Posts&#039;
    ,&#039;relate&#039; =&gt; array(
      &#039;scope&#039; =&gt; &#039;post&#039;
    )
    ,&#039;add_more&#039;=&gt; true
    ,&#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
...</code></pre>
<p>The only difference I am attempting is that I want to be able to add other custom post types (that are related to the custom post type I am editing).  I am editing a Family, and I want to be able to add Students to it.</p>
<p>The closest I got was to simply add a post-type field within the repeated form.</p>
<p><code>[&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;hidden&#039;, &#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;post_type&#039;, &#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;student&#039;]</code></p>
<p>This actually works perfectly (post is created of correct type, relationship is intact), but only for the first entry of the repeater.</p>
<p>If I click + and fill out a second form to relate a second student to the family, nothing gets saved.</p>
<p>Any idea what I&#8217;m missing?  It seems so close to the demo that I can&#8217;t imagine this couldn&#8217;t work.</p>
