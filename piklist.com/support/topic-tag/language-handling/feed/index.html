										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, I&#8217;m still trying to get my head around the framework alas I haven&#8217;t delved in much yet but it sure looks exciting.</p>
<p>However I can see that piklist is taking over the post edit screen.<br />
Firstly I would like to be able control this behavior and decide on a per post_type basis.</p>
<p>OK on to the bug.<br />
Under includes/class-piklist-cpt.php @~750 there&#8217;s a messages array that handles messages like &#8220;Post updated. View post&#8221;, &#8220;Custom field updated&#8221; etc analogous to the native one found in wp-admin/edit-form-advanced.php.</p>
<p>In piklist the <code>singular_name</code> (<code>$singular = $obj-&gt;labels-&gt;singular_name</code>) is used to compile the messages. </p>
<p>Sometimes it is adjusted for lower case using <code>strtolower</code>. However when one uses a language with a different encoding strtolower outputs gibberish.<br />
This is easily solved by using <code>mb_strtolower</code> instead. </p>
<p>The real problem when using WP in a non-English language is that <code>$singular</code><br />
is translated already and the created gettext messages such as: <code>__($singular.&#039; restored to revision from %s&#039;)</code> essentially is a mash-up of LanguageX + English.</p>
