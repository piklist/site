<p>Also, if yes, then does it also work selecting the &#8220;post&#8221; option or only when selecting the &#8220;all content&#8221; option?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi &#8211;</p>
<p>I am developing locally and have customized the user admin screen with custom fields, etc.  I would like to export the user admin customization and import it into a customer GoDaddy-managed WordPress site (so I don&#8217;t have access to the cpanel or to be able to ftp directly into the directory I&#8217;d like to).  The WordPress Export/Import function seems to handle only pages, posts, and media, and it doesn&#8217;t look like my admin screen customization is included in the resulting file when I choose to export &#8216;All&#8217;.  Any thoughts?  Thanks.</p>
