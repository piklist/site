										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating a task system with the piklist is very easy. An ad field and a check box would solve the problem.<br />
But I would like to integrate google tasks to be viewed in the wordpress panel.<br />
The direct url is easy to insert into favorites, but I would like to bring all the information inside the same window. I would like to have control of the information within the site environment (admin).<br />
I did an illustration of how I would like it.<br />
I searched for a plugin but did not find it.<br />
Can anyone tell me how I can do this with the piklist?<br />
The direct url is:<br />
