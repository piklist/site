										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,<br />
I have a requirement and don&#8217;t know how it can be achieved with piklist.</p>
<p>I created a few fields for products cpt (SKU, Description, Price etc).  In the order cpt,<br />
I managed to generate a dynamic choice field based on all the SKUs.  When the user select the relevant SKU, I would like the other fields in the order fields to be auto populated by the SKU.</p>
<p>Example,<br />
Product CPT<br />
SKU1, Shampoo, $3.00<br />
SKU2, Shampoo-go, $5.00</p>
<p>Order CPT,<br />
Select Field A, Field B, Field C<br />
[SKU1, SKU2],   &#8221; &#8220;, &#8221; &#8221;</p>
<p>When user select SKU1, I would like Field B and Field C to be auto-populated with Shampoo, and $3.00 automatically.</p>
<p>Can this be done with piklist?</p>

<p>For each song, the user should be able to add the title, artist, and a URL. This should be a repeater, so the user can add as many songs as needed. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying this, but it&#8217;s not working:</p>
<pre><code>piklist(&#039;field&#039;, array(
	
	&#039;label&#039; =&gt; &#039;Music&#039;,
	&#039;description&#039; =&gt; &#039;Add songs from this episode&#039;,
	&#039;add_more&#039; =&gt; true,

	&#039;fields&#039; =&gt; array(
		array(
			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
			&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;song title&#039;,

		),

		),

			&#039;type&#039; =&gt; &#039;text&#039;,
			&#039;value&#039; =&gt; &#039;song url&#039;,
			&#039;field&#039; =&gt; &#039;song_url&#039;
		)
	)

));</code></pre>
<p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is there a way to connect 2 different post types?<br />
I have a post type &#8220;players&#8221; with a taxonomy &#8220;teams&#8221;. I store there information about football players (1 post = 1 player). And of course I store information about teams in taxonomy (1 term = 1 team). This structure helps me to connect players with their teams.<br />
But right now I need to create one more post type &#8211; &#8220;matches&#8221;, where I&#8217;ll store all information about matches and I want to store information about players also. Right now with Piklist I can create few meta-boxes with simple repeatable textfield and save for example post links, which holds information about players. But it&#8217;s hard to do this for every match.<br />
So, is there a way to show metabox with a dropdown list, which holds terms from another post type taxonomy (teams) and checkboxes with posts in this term (players). I think this is the easiest way to pick teams and players for every match.</p>
<p>P.S. If this can be implemented in other way, I will be very appriciated for advice.  </p>
