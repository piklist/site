					<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve/Piklist.  I&#039;m very new to Piklist (trying to figure it out quickly for a project that I&#039;ve been unable to make work with other tools -- here&#039;s hoping!) and appreciate the new documentation.  I don&#039;t know how to use Github/Hugo and don&#039;t have time to figure it out now to make a change so I&#039;m just noting it here for someone there to perhaps address: most of the &quot;Piklist Checker&quot; page content (under &quot;Getting Started&quot;) also appears on the &quot;Built-In Demos&quot; page (also under &quot;Getting Started&quot;) after its content.  I was very confused at first until I realized it was describing something else.  Just wanted you to know.]]></description>
