Hi Vladimir-- Piklist 2.0 is a complete rewrite to handle Gutenberg and features we want to bring in later on.  The only known issue is the Editor field in a group repeater doesn&#039;t work well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, @Steve,

Are there any news on getting Piklist anywhere closer to being compatible to the Block Editor? If there is a branch of the plugin that works even just for popping metaboxes in the sidebar of Gutenberg editor, please let me know, so that I can give it a try.

Also, if there is a list of know issues to be dealth with, there are plenty of people who would like to help in order to have this great plugin of yours finally start working on Gutenberg too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Kelsey--  I really don&#039;t like to give ETA&#039;s, but we are really pushing to get this out in four weeks.  I totally get the user standpoint. We have clients as well that all use Piklist. We&#039;ve just elected to keep them on 4.9.x for now.

Hope you stick with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve, just checking in on the progress of Piklist being compatible with Gutenberg. Are you able to provide any timeline to when the next release will be out? It&#039;s been about 4 months from the last update and if it&#039;s going to be awhile yet, then we&#039;ll have to removed all instances of Piklist and switch to custom fields that work with Gutenberg. Would hate to do this, but for the user&#039;s standpoint, this is necessary. Look forward to an update!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve,

Is there any progress on making Gutenberg blocks using piklist ? can we have custom blocks created using piklist so that we can provide our custom fields and show outcomes in frontend ? Also can we display user frontend submit forms as gutenberg block ?  Hope there is something better happening on this end in piklist :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of my projects is about to release in this week. I have completed the project using Piklist meta-box. I am waiting for the Piklist update that will compatible with Gutenberg. Currently, Gutenberg is the default editor in the latest version of WordPress but the latest version of Piklist is not compatible with Gutenberg. When will we get the updated version of Piklist?

Hope soon will get some good news on it.]]></description>
