					<description><![CDATA[I would like to deactivate Piklist from my Wordpress account. It is currently locked (I was never given an option, it was installed and was immediately locked). The instructions above will not work because when I go to the Piklist settings page in Wordpress there is no option to &quot;Allow Deacativation&quot; or &quot;Lock.&quot; The only option in the Settings page is to allow multiple user roles. There are no options for anything else at all. Please advise.]]></description>

@hddolginoff-- If Piklist is locked, it means you have an active plugin or theme that is using Piklist. Deactivate any plugins that are using Piklist, or change your theme. The &quot;deactivate&quot; link should appear.

Let us know if you still have the notice with WordFence after you reinstall.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wordfence is warning me that my piklist/readme.txt file has been modified from the original and is advising me to uninstall/reinstall piklist.  My Version is 0.9.4.25.  Piklist appears to be locked on the installed plugins page and the only option available to me on the settings page is to allow users to be assigned multiple roles.  How do I uninstall piklist so that I can reinstall it? Or, more appropriately, how do I remedy this problem. Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I&#039;d like to see with Piklist is the ability to have it run from your theme folder rather then as a plugin. This would help negate the issue of accidental de-activation.

To elaborate a little, as Piklist is required by the theme it makes far more sense (to me) when developing a theme to keep it as part of the theme package and ensure it&#039;s always to hand. I tried to add Piklist to my theme this way and use functions.php to call it and though installs, as it uses plugins_url() to set certain paths it&#039;s breaking the CSS/JS/IMG requests. Beyond that it may work just fine but I&#039;ve not investigated this further.

Without the ability to use it in the theme I&#039;m a bit more hesitant to commit Piklist to my standard process.]]></description>

We&#039;re glad you like the locking feature.  Can you be more specific in the types of fields you would like to see?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely like this option. :)

Contratulations, GREAT Job!

A question: are you going to make a paid version? I&#039;d like to have looooots of other fields (like Google Web Fonts selection, sliders, date/time, etc).]]></description>
